            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Author's Preface.</head>
            <p>THE World is ſo earneſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Even<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War, that it has hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Leiſure enough to read the ſeveral Accounts which are continually print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that Subject: And this takes up all our Thoughts ſo much, that we have ſcarce Time to reflect on paſt Tranſactions. I muſt confeſs, we have Reaſon enough for this; for what is paſt cannot effect us much, becauſe it can neither add to our Miſery, nor better our Condition.</p>
            <p>But, the War, wherein <hi>Europe</hi> is now engag'd, is of ſo great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that, according to the Turn of Affairs, every one muſt have their Hopes or Fears, either to expect a Happy Change in their Fortunes, or to dread the contrary. Yet tho' we
<pb facs="tcp:29562:3"/> now ſeem wholly taken up with the preſent, there are, however, ſome Hiſtories of former Times capable to excite the Curioſity of the Publick, becauſe what is paſt may enable us to argue on what's to come, and to draw Conſequences accordingly.</p>
            <p>The following Hiſtory, of <hi>Van Tromp,</hi> is of this kind; and what the States have perform'd under the Conduct of that <hi>Great Man,</hi> and ſometimes, by themſelves, and againſt Two formidable Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; we may reaſonably conclude, that now, ſince the ſaid States and <hi>England</hi> are united, nothing can be able to oppoſe them at Sea, provided they will be but unanimous and act in Conſort:</p>
            <p>The manner of the Deliverance of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> in <hi>1672.</hi> from the Slavery wherewith they were threatned, next to the Favour and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Heaven, through the wiſe Conduct and Valour of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> now King of <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:29562:3"/> by the Victories which the Admirals of this State have obtain'd over both the Fleets of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> then joyn'd together, gives us very good Reaſon, likewiſe, to conclude; that there is nothing we may not at this Day expect from theſe two Potent States, ſince they have both put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Conduct of that Prince, who commands their Armies conjunctly, and ſince their Naval Forces are united againſt the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are therefore perſuaded, that this Work will not now be unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but will have the good Fortune to be well received by the variety of Events, of which we have hitherto had but a very imperfect Account; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that few Hiſtorians have made it their Buſineſs to treat at large of Matters relating to the Sea. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you will find exact Relations of many bloody Engagements perform'd in moſt Seas, and which have been
<pb facs="tcp:29562:4"/> often follow'd by Deſcents on the Territories of thoſe that have had the worſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of it. Herein you will ſee, how Victory has been diſputed between the moſt powerful, as well as moſt numerous Fleets, and the greateſt Admirals that ever fought on the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean. In a Word, you will have a full Account of what <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Provinces</hi> have hitherto been capable of executing at Sea, and when they have been the ſingle Combatants.</p>
            <p>But we will leave the Reader his full Liberty to make what Reflections he ſhall think fit, and content our ſelves with the Performance of a Faithful Hiſtorian, by giving you a plain Relation of Matters of moſt Importance in the Times we ſhall mention, and particularly of what concerns the Great <hi>Cornelius Van Tromp,</hi> whoſe Life we here preſent you. We have alſo been oblig'd, by the bye, to touch a little upon the moſt remarkable Actions of the Famous
<pb facs="tcp:29562:4"/> 
               <hi>Martin Van Tromp,</hi> and ſeveral other Admirals, whoſe Memories will always be dear to <hi>Holland,</hi> on the Account of the great Reputation they acquir'd, as well as for their Zeal ſhewn for the Service of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>It will alſo be neceſſary to acquaint you, That we have not been able (to preſerve both the Hiſtory contain'd, and the Succeſſion of Years entire) to avoid relating ſeveral Events, which ſeem to have but an indirect Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to <hi>Cornelius Van Tromp</hi>'s Life, becauſe we would fill up the <hi>Chaſms</hi> wherein he was not employ'd, nor commanded the Naval Forces of this State in chief, or elſe was in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, to make the Hiſtory the more acceptable by Variety, we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the Epitaphs of moſt of the Hero's of this Republic, whoſe Names we had occaſion to Mention, as ſo many Monuments, which contain the
<pb facs="tcp:29562:5"/> moſt important Actions of their Lives, and which are not to be found elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; whereby the Care which the <hi>United Provinces</hi> have taken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their Merit, and make their Glorious Memory Immortal, will be ſufficiently evident.</p>
            <p>We have alſo added the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Letters which the ſeveral Admirals have written, as ſo many eminent Proofs to authenticate the Actions we relate, and which will ſhew, that we have made this our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Rule and Standard, Not to write any thing with Flattery or Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, but to give a Body of Truth to this Work.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF <hi>Cornelius Tromp,</hi> Lieutenant Admiral of <hi>Holland</hi> and of <hi>Weſt-Friſeland.</hi> The Firſt BOOK.</head>
            <p>THERE is no Flouriſhing State in the World but muſt acknowledge it ſelf to be ſupported chiefly by two main firm and ſolid Pillars: I mean,<note place="margin">1650.</note> Wiſe Miniſters of State, and Great and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd Commanders, who Conſtitute the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cauſe of it's Grandure and Exaltation. The former of theſe by their admirable Skill form out into Regular deſigns in the Councel Chamber thoſe Secret Maxims that Policy Dictates to every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the moſt adapted to their peculiar Genius and condition, whereby they may beſt Govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29562:6"/> grow powerfull and become formidable to their Neighbours; and the others are thoſe Hero's that in order to put in Execution what was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the Cabal of State couragiouſly lead on the Armies, fight the Enemies, and gloriouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Victories: all which duly conſidered, what honours ought not to be rendred to the Memory of thoſe great men after their Deaths? Certainly it is not only juſt to give them in ſome ſort a new life by the Recital of their noble Exploits, but it is likewiſe of great uſe to others, to render them Recommendable to Proſterity by a Hiſtory of their worthy Actions, ſince 'tis the ſureſt and moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious means to move thoſe who read it to a like Courſe of Vertue, and to excite them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Steps of thoſe Illuſtrious Hero's that have generouſly Sacrificed their own private repoſe, and ſpilt their beſt Blood for the Glory of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. 'Twas upon this conſideration that the Greeks and Romans, not to ſpeak of the Nations that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them, took ſuch great care to commit to writing the lives of their Brave men, and were ſo accurate to Paint them out to us in ſuch lively and natural Colours, that even to this day, at that vaſt diſtance whenever we Read their ſtory, we are apt to fancy, we ſee themſelves before our Eyes. But if thoſe two Renowned Nations took ſuch a Religious care to conſecrate the Memory of their great Captains to Immortality, what ought not <hi>Holland</hi> to do, to Immortalize that of its Famous Admirals? If ever there were any State that has made a noiſe in the World, and made it ſelf formidable by Sea, is it not this powerfull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick which has done more in this reſpect, than all other States put together beſides? It would be but needleſs here to repeat the Hiſtory of it's firſt riſe, and of it's progreſſes ſince, and to enter into ſo long and particular a Narration as that would require, to prove a truth ſo generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. Neither as to the Hiſtory of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29562:6"/> is our Age the firſt that has employed it's writers upon ſo noble a Subject, our Anceſtors have led the way, and ſet us worthy Patterns how to acquit our ſelves of this Juſt duty. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly emboldened by their Example I venture to Compoſe the Hiſtory of one of thoſe Hero's, who without tarniſhing the glory of the others may be ſaid to have been one of the greateſt and moſt Renowned Commanders that ever appeared on the Ocean, a Hero whoſe very name was a terror to his Enemies; That was deſcended of a Father who had been preſent in above Fifty Sea Battles in which he either Commanded in chief, or had at leaſt one of the principal Poſts of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, whoſe good Conduct and undaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage had much contributed to make <hi>Holland</hi> one of the Richeſt and moſt flouriſhing States of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> and who at laſt after gaining ſo many Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and Victories, died with Sword in hand for the advantage of his Country; a Hero, in fine, that alway followed the glorious foot ſteps of his Illuſtrious Father, who was as much beloved by his own Sea-men and people, as he was dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Enemies, and who in a ſupreme degree poſſeſt all the vertues of a great and accompliſh'd Captain.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſay nothing of the firſt years of the life of <hi>Cornelius Tromp,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory we deſign here to write, becauſe there uſually happens nothing to men in that time of infancy that much concerns or is much worth the Curioſity of the publick.</p>
            <p>It will be enough only to remark to you that having been as 'twere wholly nouriſh'd and brought up at Sea from his moſt tender youth, ſcarcely was he arrived to a Capacity of Commanding but he was made Captain of a Ship which imployment he diſcharged with ſo much Courage and Ability that gave the World a certain prognoſtick, he was deſtinated to exerciſe thoſe of greater importance.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:29562:7"/>
            <p>One of the firſt occaſions in which he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and of which doubtleſs a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation will be acceptable, was in the War the States were obliged to make againſt the Corſairs of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary.</hi> For thoſe Pyrates taking daily a great Number of <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant-Ships, bound either to <hi>Spain,</hi> or for divers other ports in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean;</hi> the States at length tired out and vext with ſo many loſſes, gave order to <hi>John de Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> Famous for his brave Actions, to Joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Commander <hi>de Wilde,</hi> and to the Capt. <hi>Tromp,</hi> and <hi>Van Velſen,</hi> to go before <hi>Sally,</hi> and to Block up that Port by Sea, in order by that means, to put a ſtop to the Courſe of it's Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>He had orders to Convoy by the way, as far as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz,</hi> all Merchant-Ships going into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and to ſteer away from thence towards <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Accordingly Setting ſail and being come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Seas, he was inform'd by Captain <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries</hi> who was Cruiſing there, that no Corſair had yet appeared in thoſe parts, becauſe thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> were at <hi>Inteſtine</hi> Jars about the Government, and that they of the old Town had taken up arms againſt thoſe of the new; but that notwithſtanding the differences among themſelves, they were unanimouſly inclined to hearken to a Treaty of Peace when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhould be offered to them by the States General, becauſe they ſtood in much fear of their power. And in effect, <hi>de Galen</hi> was no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived thither, but a Negotiation was preſently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into to draw up the Conditions of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>In order to which, it was firſt agreed upon, that as ſoon as the <hi>Moors</hi> ſhould have put up a White Flag in the Fort, <hi>de Galen</hi> ſhould put up the like upon his Main-Maſt-Top, for a Signal that the Deputies of <hi>Sally,</hi> might ſafely come on Board the Admiral.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That all Chriſtian ſlaves of what Nation ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that had been taken on Board any</hi> Dutch <hi>Ships, ſhould be Releaſed without Ranſome and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wrong done to them.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That no Corſair Ship ſhould be ſuffered to go out of</hi> Sally, <hi>without giving in firſt ſufficient ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that none of the Sates Ships ſhould be moleſted by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That ſuch</hi> Dutch <hi>Ships as had been taken by the Corſairs of</hi> Algier <hi>or</hi> Tunis, <hi>and brought into their Ports to be ſold, ſhould be Reſtored into the hands of their Reſpective owners.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:29562:8"/>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That it ſhould not be lawfull to retain any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Subject of the united Provinces, as a ſlave, nor to ſell him as ſuch within the Countries under their Juriſdiction, but he ſhould be immediately ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That the</hi> Hollanders <hi>ſhould Trade freely and ſafely with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>That no Merchandiſes Imported or Exported by the</hi> Hollanders <hi>ſhould pay any higher Duties, than thoſe of the</hi> Moors <hi>themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That if it ſo pleaſed their High and Mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the Sates, their Allies ſhould likewiſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the ſame Treaty. And laſtly that this Treaty ſhould in all points be obſerved as firmly and inviolably as the Treaty before made between the ſaid States and the King of</hi> Morocco. <hi>It was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thought fit by the Council on our ſide, that Captain</hi> de Uries <hi>ſhould take Boat and go into</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>to puſh on with ſo much the more Vigour the Negotiation of the Peace.</hi>

            <p>In the mean while in ſpite of all the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of our men in guarding the Avenues of the Port, one of their Corſairs, ſlily gliding in along by the Ramparts, ſtole into the Town. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, Captain <hi>de Wilde,</hi> was ordered to go with his Ship to <hi>Mamore</hi> a little ſorry Town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 500 paces from the main Sea, ſituated at the mouth of the River <hi>Subus,</hi> and twelve Miles diſtant from the Town of <hi>Sally,</hi> with deſign to ſtop up that paſſage from the Enemies, and to hinder them from watering there. He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there by the Governour with great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of friendſhip, and after he had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Orders he had Received, he returned again to his Station before <hi>Sally,</hi> where he was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed to ſee the Treaty of Peace broken off.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Moors</hi> were ſo far from conſenting to Releaſe the Priſoners without Ranſome, that they would not endure to hear it mov'd, and thoſe of

               <hi>Aribal</hi> were ſo refractary as to make a difficulty likewiſe of accepting the other Articles of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Which obſtinacy in thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> had like to have provoked the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to ſhew their Reſentment by the laſt extremities; however, they could not forbear replying to them in ſuch high Terms as ſufficiently teſtified how deeply they were incens'd at their proceedings.

            <p>In the interim our Admiral had advice, that there had appeared about <hi>Cape</hi> St. <hi>Vincent</hi> ſeven <hi>French</hi> Privateers looking ſharp after Merchant Ships: Upon which, <hi>de Wilde, Tromp,</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

This Menace made the Officers of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, who were then all preſent, to yield to thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that the ſlaves ſhould be ranſom'd, at the Price they were firſt bought for. And as to the reſt of the Arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>es there was all likelihood they would have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to, if the <hi>Moors</hi> had not changed their minds on a ſudden, and ſtarted abundance of New difficulties againſt the advancement of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, upon occaſion of ſome advice that was come to them from <hi>Tetuan,</hi> which gave them hopes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29562:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> to compaſs the deſtruction of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, which was this: Nine <hi>Algerine Corſairs</hi> that put in for Refreſhment there, had ſignified to them, that they had a deſign to ſurprize and ſeize one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships that were riding before <hi>Sally.</hi> Admiral <hi>de Galen</hi>'s Ship, was in moſt danger, and moſt expoſed, becauſe he was often all alone. The noiſe of this enterprize being confirmed by <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries,</hi> put the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commanders upon more Circumſpection in obſerving the Enemies. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ships of the Fleet tackt and ſtood back towards the Admiral, and uſed all the precautions vigilance could inſpire them, to avoid a ſurprize. In the mean while, they beginning to want freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Tromp</hi> was detacht away, to fetch them ſome from <hi>La <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

During theſe tranſactions, <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries</hi> came back on board the Admiral, with Letters, and brought with him a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Merchant. But <hi>de Galen</hi> thought not fit to make any anſwer to theſe Letters, becauſe he knew well enough, that the Prince of South <hi>Sally</hi> was ſet out ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:29562:9"/>
            <p>Aſſoon as the Princes of <hi>Sally</hi> were returned from <hi>Fez,</hi> they preſently ſent to give the Fleet notice of their arrival, ſignifying withall, that there was nothing they more heartily deſired than a Peace, and that they paſſionately long'd to ſee the Treaty already begun, brought to a happy Concluſion. At the ſame time, Captain <hi>Blok,</hi> who was diſpacht out of the <hi>Texel</hi> to go to <hi>Sally,</hi> arrived there with orders to <hi>De Galen</hi> from the States, to go away for the Coaſts of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> or <hi>Rochel,</hi> to Convoy the Merchant Ships that were to go back from thence towards <hi>Holland.

            <p>After this Peace, <hi>Holland</hi> had ſome grounds to hope ſhe ſhould enjoy many long years of Repoſe, and after having by that laid open to her ſelf the Commerce of the <hi>Levant,</hi> ſhe might fill her Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers with new Riches. But Fortune that ſeems to have made it her buſineſs to keep this Republick in a perpetual agitation, made her ſoon perceive, that the Peace ſhe had newly concluded with thoſe Barbarians, was deſigned only to prepare her for a much more bloody and dangerous War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> at that time had erected her ſelf into a Republick, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1652"/> and expulſed from the Government the Heirs of the Crown, who thereby were forced to ſeek an <hi>Aſylum</hi> abroad, and implore the Succour and Protection of <hi>France</hi> and of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces:</hi> And the unexperienc'd youth of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. having ſwell'd the daring and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious humour of the Protector <hi>Cromwel</hi> beyond all bounds, as ſeeing himſelf Arbitrary Maſter of that potent Nation over which he Lorded it with an Empire more Abſolute than that of any Crown'd Heads, <hi>Holland</hi> had reaſon from thence, to dread ſome very fatal Conſequences. For that new Republick
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29562:11"/> grown inſolent with the many advantages ſhe had newly gain'd againſt the Family of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> thought there was left nothing elſe in the world capable to ſtop the career of her Ambition; and was ſo wonderfully increas'd in power, that ſhe begun to grow inſupportable to her Neighbours, and particularly to the United Provinces, who ſaw themſelves upon the point of coming to a Rupture with her. But in regard the late long War they had had with <hi>Spain</hi> had not yet given them time enough to recover their ſtrength, they choſe rather to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize a while with <hi>England,</hi> than to embroil themſelves haſtily in a new War. And therefore employ'd all ſort of means imaginable to divert that Storm, by haſtning to ſend Ambaſſadors into <hi>England.</hi> Accordingly the Heers <hi>Cats, Schaap,</hi> and <hi>Vander-perre</hi> were diſpatcht to <hi>London</hi> in that quality, who were received there with great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, but yet in ſuch a manner as promis'd nothing leſs than a happy iſſue of their Negotiation.</p>
            <p>In the mean while; <hi>Holland</hi> was no longer able to keep ſilence after the many bloody outrages ſhe had received from the <hi>English.</hi> For her Merchant-Ships had ſuffered and daily ſuffered loſſes that were reckoned to amount to ſome Millions, by the Prizes taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Privateers, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of near two hundred Ships. Yet <hi>Holland</hi> had thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſuffered all thoſe cruel Hoſtilities without complaining, and would not perhaps have come to an open Rupture for them: So much did ſhe dread the diſmal conſequences of a War that had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground but Ambition, if her too great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had not at length been puſht to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. But that which ſeemed an unexampled piece of Hardſhip impoſed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on the <hi>Dutch,</hi> was that they pretended, they ought to be permitted even in the midſt of a profound Peace, to viſit not only the Merchant Ships of the States, but their Men of War too, under pretence they carried Contraband Goods to their Enemies. And beſides,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29562:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> that, they had forbidden them to traffick into that part of the <hi>Iſlands</hi> call'd the <hi>Antilles,</hi> under their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Notwithſtanding all that, the States ſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to their Ambaſſadors, to try all amicable ways to come, if 'twere poſſible, to an accommodation: but when they ſaw there was no hopes of Peace, they took at laſt a reſolution to arm, for the ſecurity of their Commerce. Then the Engliſh made no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to declare openly to our Ambaſſadors, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Sea belonged to them, that they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways oppoſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> keeping a Fleet there, becauſe that was a Right belonging to them, which their Anceſtors had gotten by dint of Sword from other Nations; And therefore that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer any other Flagg to appear upon the Ocean, but that of their own Republick.</p>
            <p>However, this Declaration hindred not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Army of the United Provinces, being then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, from diſpoſing it ſelf to ſet Sail under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to that High Office in the year 1637, in the room of the Sieur <hi>Dorp,</hi> who quitted the Service. But before they ſet out, <hi>Tromp</hi> deſired the States to give him directions how he ſhould behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards the Engliſh concerning the honour of the Flagg, of which they have in all times been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely jealous. The States askt him how he had behav'd himſelf in that point in the time of King <hi>Charles; Tromp</hi> replied, that when any Engliſh Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels happned to meet them towards <hi>Callice</hi> or near the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially if the Engliſh were ſtrongeſt, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> uſed to ſalute them with ſome diſcharge of their Canon, and by low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering their Flag; upon which, the States left the matter to his diſcretion, to act therein according as his prudence ſhould direct him; ordering him to do nothing to the diſadvantage of the Nation, or prejudicial to the Glory of the State; And that he ſhould defend their Veſſels from all manner of attempts againſt any that ſhould attack them: And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29562:12"/> that however, to avoid giving any new matter of jealouſie to the <hi>English,</hi> he ſhould endeavour not to go near their Coaſts.</p>
            <p>But a Tempeſt and contrary Winds hapening to ariſe, <hi>Tromp</hi> was forced to quit the Coaſts of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and much againſt his will, to make towards the <hi>English</hi> Coaſt, to ſave his Fleet, and to preſerve it from a fatal Shipwrack, but he quitted it again as ſoon as poſſible he could, and made towards <hi>Callis.</hi> A while after being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Seven <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant Ships Richly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den were coming from the <hi>Streights,</hi> and that two Engliſh men of War and ſome Frigats were in queſt of them to take them, <hi>Tromp</hi> changed his Courſe to go to their aſſiſtance. And in his way near <hi>Dover,</hi> on the 29th. of <hi>May,</hi> he met <hi>Robert Blake</hi> Admiral for the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> having under his Command a Fleet of about 28 Capital Men of War and Frigats, that put to Sea the 5th. of <hi>May</hi> to go a cruiſing upon the Coaſts of the <hi>Low Countries. Tromp</hi> ſeeing him diſpoſed himſelf to pay the uſual Honours to the Banner of <hi>England,</hi> and likewiſe ordered a Boat to be ready to carry one of his Captains on board the Admiral to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment him. But <hi>Blake</hi> who was in the <hi>James</hi> carrying 82 Guns and 700 Men, not minding all thoſe marks of Submiſſion, or at leaſt making as if he perceived them not, made three Canon Shots one after another at <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Ship, called the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derode,</hi> carrying 54 Guns, and 250 Men, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not the Engliſh Admiral till after the third Shot: And then 'twas, that the Fight began to grow hot, and Bloody, the two Fleets continuing to Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nade one another for four full hours, and then were parted more by the obſcurity of the night, than for having ſatisfied the eager deſire they had to fight.</p>
            <p>The two Naval Armies then Sheering off into the main Sea, fell to work each of them to repair their loſſes, and together together the veſſels ſhatter'd and ſcattered in the fight. The <hi>Hollanders</hi>

                  <p>SInce my laſt of the 20th Inſtant, after having Cruized before the <hi>Meuſe, Wielengen, Oſtend,</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> till the 24th. we were forced to weigh Anchor, becauſe of the Boiſtrous Weather, and the Tempeſt growing ſtill more furious, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Captains came aboard the Admiral, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him what Anchors, and Cables they had loſt, ſome of them having but two left; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Wind continued to grow more violent,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29562:13"/> we Reſolved for the preventing of a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſter, to make towards the Coaſt of <hi>Dover.</hi> We got into the <hi>Downs</hi> at one a Clock, when I immediately diſpatcht away Captain <hi>Theyſſen</hi> of Fluſhing, and Captain <hi>Allen,</hi> to Compliment <hi>Bourn,</hi> who was then Riding there with a Squadron of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet under his Command, and to deſire him from me, to take no Alarm at the ſight of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> upon the Coaſts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> becauſe it hapned only by an unexpected effect of the Tempeſtuous Weather, and to aſſure him, they had no other deſign there than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit their Veſſels in order to return as ſoon as they could, towards the Frontiers of the State, and that the Orders we had from the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral concerned only the ſecurity of our Trade and Fiſhing, and maintaining the Glory of our Nation. <hi>Bourn</hi> having heard this Meſſage, made anſwer thereto with ſome Compliments he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my two Officers to make me, deſiring them withall, to return me his thanks for my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement. The 29th. of the ſame Month, we unmoor'd with a Wind blowing freſh at North-Eaſt, ſteering our Courſe towards <hi>Callice,</hi> with deſign to go and Cruize upon our own Coaſts, to refurniſh our ſelves with Anchors and Cables. We met in our way, the Captain <hi>Van Saanen</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> coming from the <hi>Streights,</hi> with Captain <hi>Huntbuyt,</hi> who informed us, that being come along with Seven Merchant Ships valued at above 50 Tuns of Gold, they had left them at Anchor right againſt <hi>Fiverly,</hi> not far off from 12 Men of War belonging to the <hi>English</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And how that the aboveſaid <hi>Van Saa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,</hi> having likewiſe met on the 22d. of <hi>May,</hi> near to <hi>Goudſtart,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Frigat that would needs have obliged him to ſtrike to her, againſt which he defended himſelf about two hours, till at laſt ſhe was forced to quit him; all theſe Circumſtances had obliged him to make to the Fleet,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29562:13"/> to give them notice in what danger the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Ships were. This made me Reſolve to go to their aſſiſtance, and to Reſcue them out of the hands of the Enemies, according to the 7th. and 8th. Article of my Commiſſion. In our way we met 15 of the Parliaments men of War, or Frigats, upon which I preſently lower'd my Sails, and ſtruck my Flag, in order to pay the Honours due to the Banner of <hi>England.</hi> Being come within Cannon ſhot, the <hi>English</hi> Admiral let flie a ſhot at me, to which I made no Anſwer; he then gave me another, to which I Anſwer'd, upon which he let flie a whole Broad ſide at me, which made ſo great Havock on board me, that ſeveral of my men were Wounded, and ſome of them had their Arms or Legs ſhot off. I then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcharged a Broad ſide at him, yet was not able all this while to diſcover what the <hi>English</hi> mean't by this, ſo great a ſilence there was kept on both ſides. And thus the two Fleets came all on a ſudden to be Engag'd in a general Battle. In the mean while Major <hi>Bourn</hi> being come out of the <hi>Downs</hi> with a Squadron of 12 men of War, or Frigats, whereof the firſt carried from 60 to 70 pieces of Cannon, and the others from 38 to 50, came and fell thundring upon our Rear. So the Fight being begun at 4 in the afternoon, laſted till 9, and was not broken off but by the obſcurity of the Night. Then we made out into the Main Sea, and the Ships of both Fleets tack't about to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Admirals, to refit themſelves. We remained all the Night, hanging lights out in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ship. The 30th. in the Morning, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the <hi>English</hi> Fleet to the Leeward, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards <hi>Dover.</hi> We have loſt two of our Ships that were in our Rear, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe Commanded by the Captains <hi>Tuynemans</hi> of <hi>Middleburg,</hi> and <hi>Sipke Fokkes,</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> this laſt having had all his Maſts ſhot do vncloſe by the Board. The Maſter and other Officers reported to us, that they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29562:14"/> were taken by three of the Parliaments Ships about 9 a Clock at Night, who after they had taken out of her the Captain and Lieutenant with about 14 or 15 men, put a great many <hi>English</hi> on board her, but they being afraid ſhe would ſink under them, after they had Plunder'd her, quitted her. They reported likewiſe, that Captain <hi>Tuyneman</hi>'s Ship was taken an hour before theirs. We deſign now to Cruiſe along the Channel, to ſeek out our Merchant Ships coming from the <hi>Streights,</hi> and to Convoy them all together home to our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Tromp</hi> diſpatcht away an Expreſs into <hi>England,</hi> with the Copy of his Letter to the States, to be delivered to our Ambaſſadours there. And to make it appear more Authentick, he caus'd it to be ſign'd by all the Officers of the Fleet. But it happen'd, that their High and Mightineſſes Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, having left <hi>London</hi> becauſe of the thick Fogs that uſually infect the Air there, were gone then to Reſide at <hi>Chelſey,</hi> and the Expreſs being ſtopt, <hi>Tromp</hi>'s diſpatches were not deliver'd to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Admiral Ship, leaking on all ſides, and very much ſhatter'd, had much ado to get into the <hi>Downs.</hi> There <hi>Blake</hi> Buried his Dead, in the Number of which were his Maſter and ſeveral other Perſons of Note, to whom he cauſed very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar honours to be rendred; which done, he put Pen to Paper to inform the Parliament of all that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

Upon the advice Major <hi>Bourn</hi> gave me, that <hi>Tromp</hi> appear'd toward the Souther-ſand with a Fleet of 40 ſail, I uſed all poſſible diligence
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29562:14"/> to get up with him. Yeſterday we diſcovered him below <hi>Dover</hi> Rode, and being come within 3 miles of him, <hi>Tromp</hi> unmoored with an Eaſterly Wind, which made us think he endeavoured to avoid us, becauſe of the diſpute about the Flag. About two hours after, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet changing it's courſe, tackt about, and ſtood right towards us, <hi>Tromp</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the head of this motion. We put our ſelves into a line of Battle, not doubting but <hi>Tromp</hi>'s intention was to Engage. When the two Fleets were come within Musket ſhot of one another, I made a ſhot at his Flagg, which I Repeated three times: After the third ſhot, <hi>Tromp</hi> let flie at us a whole broad ſide. In the mean while Major <hi>Bourn</hi> coming out of the <hi>Downs</hi> brought a new Squadron of men of War to the fight, which ceaſed not till Night put an end to it; and then our Ships not being able to keep the Sea any longer, becauſe of the great quantity of Maſts Sails and Cordage we had loſt, it was Reſolv'd by the advice of all the Captains, to come to an Anchor at 3 miles off the <hi>Neſs,</hi> where we kept hard at work all night in Refitting our Ships. The next Morning at break of day, we diſcover'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet about 4 miles from us, making towards the Coaſt of <hi>France.</hi> We Judged fit in a Councel of War, to keep the Weather gage of them, to prevent a ſurprize, in caſe they ſhould Charge us again, that ſo at the worſt, we might have nothing elſe to do but to cut the Cables of our Anchors. As yet we have not been able to diſcover whither they are ſteering, nor what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage they have ſuſtain'd. But however we are aſſur'd, that one of their Ships is ſunk, and that we have taken another from them of 30 guns, with two Captains. The firſt of theſe Ships hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Main Maſt ſhot by the Board, and leak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all ſides, Captain <hi>Laarſons</hi> was fain to quit her. We had in this fight 6 killed, 9 or 10 Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded, and 25 leſs dangerouſly; among
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29562:15"/> which number are my Maſter, one of his Mates, and ſome other under Officers. The Admiral Ship received in her ſides, and maſts, about 70 great ſhot, and in her ſails and Rigging, almoſt an infinite Number, I having been engaged with the Main body of the Enemies Fleet for about four full hours. Notwithſtanding which, our happineſs is to be admired at, that we received no more damage, and we have reaſon to hope, that the protection of God will favour our Arms, if a War ſhould once break out between the two Nations. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are the Aggreſſours, and watch all occaſions to come and affront us, and Brave us upon our own Coaſts, as Experience has newly ſhewn us.</p>

            <p>The News of this Fight being brought to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> ſo wrought upon the <hi>Mobb,</hi> that they made an inſurrection, and went all in a fury to <hi>Chelſey</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors were lodged, with deſign to have ſacrificed them to their Reſentments, if the Parliament had not provided before hand againſt the miſchief, by ſending them a body of Horſe to Guard all the paſſages about their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with ſtrict command, to let no body go in or out. And beſides preventing by that means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſorder, they deſigned by the ſame Expedient, to cut off all ways of Correſpondence from the Ambaſſadors.</p>
            <p>In the mean while there was nothing to be heard but Complaints and Murmurings from all parts. For the Country people in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> were ſo alarmed at this news, that many of them deſerted their houſes, and others came and Complain'd to the Parliament, Repreſenting to them what great danger their Coaſts were as being the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to an Invaſion, and putting them in fear that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would come and Ravage the whole Country. Upon which, <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> then General of all the Forces of <hi>England,</hi> and who was the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> of that Infant-Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29562:15"/> immediately ſet out towards the Maritime pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well to appeaſe the peoples diſturbed Spirits, as to inform himſelf of the particulars of the fight. Some Regiments were likewiſe detach'd from the Army, and order'd to march towards the Sea Coaſts, which were Quarter'd at <hi>Greenwich, Graveſend, Sandwich,</hi> and <hi>Dover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwell</hi> having carefully Examined into all the reports of the Battle, was very ill ſatisfied at it, and ſo much the more becauſe Captain <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Brandley,</hi> and Captain <hi>Dennis Bond,</hi> both <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Men that were in <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle at that time, agreed together, as well as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains, <hi>Tuynemans</hi> and <hi>Sipke Fokkes,</hi> who were priſoners, that it was their opinion, that <hi>Blake</hi> had made three ſhots at <hi>Tromp,</hi> before he offered to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. After ſuch a diſcovery as that, <hi>Cromwell</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> and at his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, all was pacified, and the unruly <hi>Mobb</hi> quietly laid down their arms.</p>
            <p>However what had paſt, left no Room for any to doubt, but that a War would thereupon break out between thoſe two potent Republicks, tho' both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties endeavoured to excuſe and Juſtifie themſelves of any blame in the matter, becauſe they were loth to paſs for the Authors of the ſad-diſaſters that muſt needs enſue thereon. For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were the Aggreſſors, but they maintained the contrary. <hi>Tromp</hi> having writ a Letter to the States with all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Fight, as we have already ſeen, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed likewiſe a more exact information to be drawn up of the whole matter of Fact, which was ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Forty <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers of the Fleet. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the whole account of that action, and of all it's particulars; and all the Captains unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed in their report, that <hi>Tromp</hi> had no other deſign in this Expedition, than to maintain the freedom of Commerce, and that he intended to pay the honours due to the <hi>English</hi> Flag, but that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29562:16"/> Admiral <hi>Blake</hi> had made three ſhot at him with his Guns, before he made any at him, till at laſt his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience being puſht to the utmoſt extremity, he found himſelf obliged to anſwer him in the like Language, at the third diſcharge.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide all the Captains of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, being likewiſe called together by the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's command, drew up a <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> by which, after they had related all the Circumſtances of the fight, they pretended to prove, that <hi>Tromp</hi> came up to the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, only to dare them, tho' he againſt all ſence, thought to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the ſpecious pretence of coming only to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant Fleet, when it was well known they had already weighed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and paſt by the <hi>Saturday</hi> before, in ſight of Admiral <hi>Blake,</hi> who never made the leaſt offer to attack them. That <hi>Tromp</hi> with a very Criminal boldneſs coming to an Anchor before <hi>Dover,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made offer to ſalute the Caſtle, tho' the Caſtle had diſcharged three Guns, at three different times, to give him notice of his duty; but that yet <hi>Tromp</hi> out of contempt, diſſembling that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, remained in his poſt all Night, and next day till Noon, without ſtriking his Flag. And to add the more weight to this <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> added ſome Articles of the orders that <hi>Tromp</hi> had given the Captains of his Fleet; which the <hi>English</hi> had gotten information of from the two <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains they had taken priſoners. They contained among other things,</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">I. That the Chiefs or Captains of Squadrons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Equip'd, or to be hereafter Equip'd, had Expreſs Orders to take care to preſerve the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels belonging to theſe Provinces, and not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be viſited; without compriſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the diſputes that neceſſarily happen at Sea concerning the paſsports and Evidences that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ship whatever ſhe be, is obliged to ſhew at the firſt demand, according to the Marine Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29562:16"/> concluded with the K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> the 17 of <hi>December</hi> 1650. That they ſhould defend them from all manner of Attempts, and Endeavour to re-take them from thoſe who ſhould have taken them, by employing for that effect their whole force againſt the Aggreſſor, for the ſervice of their Country, and Act in all things conformably to their Commiſſion, and to the Cuſtoms of Sea-faring men.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That if in fighting againſt any Foreign Ships whether to defend themſelves, or other Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the State, they ſhould happen to take them, they ſhould be obliged to carry them into <hi>Holland,</hi> with a very exact information of all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages between them, to be preſented to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty of the place from which the Victorious Ship ſet out.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To theſe Articles, they added beſides, that every Chief, or Captain ſhould keep his Guns and his Arms always in readineſs, and ſhould tack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout towards the Admiral, and the main body of the Fleet, upon ſight of any Foreign Man of War. That he ſhould take good heed to the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of War, and mind whether it were offenſive or defenſive, that by protecting the States Ships and not ſuffering them to be viſited, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt, in order to gain ſome advantage upon the Enemy. That if they took any of their Ships, they ſhould carry it under the Admirals Flag; but that as ſoon as the bloody Flag ſhould be taken down, all acts of Hoſtility ſhould ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It was moreover expreſly forbidden them, to pay any ſalutes with their Guns, by way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to any, unleſs upon very good grounds;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29562:17"/> that however, if they chanced to come near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Foreign Man of War, which they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a kind of an Engagement to ſalute, becauſe it concerned the honour of the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo to do, they ſhould in ſuch caſes, uſe great Circumſpection, eſpecially if the Chiefs or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of ſuch Foreign Ships ſhould have firſt ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Lieutenant General, or him that commands in his place, but above all, they were to take care, it might be done without damage.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe when any of the Ships of the Fleet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent a cruiſing to Sea, ſhould diſcover any Foreign Ship; or, that ſhe got Intelligence that Warlike preparations were making any where, and that Ships were gathering together, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Fleet, then the ſaid Ship was to get the exacteſt information poſſible, of the Number of their Men of War, and of their Arms, Guns, and Men, that ſhe ſhould take good notice, which way they ſteer'd, and whether in their paſſage, they offer'd to commit any act of Hoſtility. That in this caſe, they ſhould give the Admiral advice of it with all the diligence imaginable, who thereupon, was to give the following Orders, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſcouts be ſent to all parts of the Seas, that all the Ships of the Fleet ſhould repair to the appointed <hi>Rendevous,</hi> where they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult together what deſign the Fleet ſo diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might have, what courſe they ſteer'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what Harbour they would enter, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of the ports belonging to the States, or ſome other. And if it ſhould happen, they had fail'd at firſt to uſe all thoſe precautions, that then they ſhould let off a Great Gun for a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; that ſo every one taking notice it was an Extraordinary Signal, and Judging from thence of the importance of the buſineſs, might return anſwer thereto, each of them likewiſe, with a Gun Extraordinary; after which every one of them ſhould be obliged to make to the place
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29562:17"/> whence the firſt Gun was fired, that all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Fleet meeting together on board the Admiral, might take ſuch Reſolutions as ſhould be moſt convenient for the time, and for the good of the State.</p>
            </q>
            <p>From which Articles and Inſtructions of <hi>Tromp</hi> to his Officers, tho' the <hi>English</hi> pretended to draw invincible proofs, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors in the late bloody attempt upon their Fleet, yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> on the contrary, pretended it was viſible from thence, that their main Aim was only to ſecure their Trade, and defend the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Nation, in caſe they were attackt, but that they had not the leaſt deſign to be Aggreſſors againſt the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> whilſt he was Cruiſing below <hi>Bullen,</hi> writ a Letter to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Blake,</hi> dated the 2d. of <hi>June,</hi> in which he intreated him to releaſe the two Capt. of his, he had made Priſoners, and who were already carried to <hi>London,</hi> and to order the Reſtitution of Captain <hi>Tuyneman</hi>'s Ship.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Blake</hi> as yet red hot with Reſentment, for what was ſo newly paſt between them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much ſurprized, that after the Rough Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments between them in that Rencounter, <hi>Tromp</hi> ſhould preſume to Write to him upon ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as that, in very great indignation, made him the following Anſwer.</p>

All thoſe ſtories that are whiſper'd about concerning this matter, are already lookt upon by the people, as the mournful preſages of the ruine of two States that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ever linkt together in a ſtrict Alliance, and now by this fatal blow, ſee themſelves at the eve of a Bloody War. We are ſo ſenſibly concern'd at all the falſe Rumours that are ſpread abroad to the diſadvantage of our Nation, that we will call God to witneſs, that the States General were ſo far from contributing to the late unhappy recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they had not the leaſt knowledge of it, and deſire nothing ſo much as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Peace, and an inviolable Friendſhip with <hi>England.</hi> However 'tis not impertinent to the matter in queſtion, to let you know, that it may be obſerv'd from the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29562:19"/> written to us by the Admiral of <hi>Holland,</hi> that the true Cauſe of that action was very different from what 'tis reported to have been: And what is more, <hi>Tromp</hi> declares in that Letter, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, and he repeats it three times, that he had not received any other Orders from the States, than only to defend the Merchant Ships belonging to the States, from the oppreſſion of thoſe who might be capable to diſturb the freedom of their Commerce, and to Cruiſe upon the Frontiers of the State with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going far from <hi>Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Newport;</hi> from whence 'tis as clear as the day, That the States General of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces never had any thoughts to attempt any thing that might be capable to break the ſtrict union that has always been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> And if any thing has hapned contrary to the ſincerity of their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they who ſhall be found to have violated the Rules, and paſſed the Bounds that were preſcribed them, ought to be Reſponſible for it.</p>
                  <p>According to the Orders given us by their High and Mightineſſes, to endeavour a Treaty of Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we preſented ſome days ago to your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, a Memorial, in which we propoſe means, not only for compoſing the differences about Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, but likewiſe for the ſecuring of it, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it more flouriſhing. And we deſire nothing elſe at preſent but to ſee them brought to a ſpeedy and happy concluſion. And indeed who could believe, that a Treaty that is at preſent the firmeſt ſupport of good and well diſpoſed people, and the moſt ſolid foundation of the Reformation, ſhould be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the capricious humour of a few ill intention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons? It is a Natural Law acknowledged by all the World, That, in Private Affairs, if an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney or Proctor; or in Publick Affairs, if a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State, offers to paſs the Duties of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; or if a General of an Army, without any Order from his Soveraign, Ravages and lays Waſt the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29562:19"/> Countries of his Allies, or like a wild unruly Beaſt that has broken his Chains, runs about the Fields and does all the miſchief he can, then in ſuch a caſe, it is but Juſtice to hold the Soveraigns blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and to charge the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

However there is no doubt, but that it would be a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unheard of, and condemned both by Divine and Humane Laws, to go about to commit any acts of Hoſtility, without hearing firſt what reaſons the Adverſary had to alledge for himſelf. 'Tis a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime univerſally received by all Nations conducted by the light of Reaſon, That when any miſchievous fact is committed, the examination of the crime, ſhould precede before Sentence be given; But like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if the Party offended receive ample ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ought he not to lay by his Reſentment? And it is not to be wondred at, if all Nations natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally avoid War, and are inclined to Peace, ſince War is a horrible Monſter that cauſes a thouſand unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and feeds upon nothing but innocent Blood. Some holy Fathers of the Church have very truly and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſaid, That men ought to have War in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, even when Juſtice or Neceſſity it ſelf obliges them by force to take Arms, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Chriſtians, who ought to have learnt to be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Blood of other people as well as of that of their own Subjects. Experience ſhews us in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, that when the moſt excellent Wines come to corrupt, they change into Vinegar moſt extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſharp.

                  <p>Truly our ſenſe in this caſe differs nothing from that of ſome of your Writers, who have very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly compared our two Republicks to two Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Veſſels floating on the Sea, with this <hi>Motto, Si collidimur fragimur, i. e.</hi> If we fall foul on one another, we ſhall certainly break. That is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem that admirably well ſhews that a perpetual Peace ought to render them inſeparable. For if a well cemented <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion might once be ſettled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Nations, what felicities are there they might not enjoy?

In fine, to conclude, we therefore moſt earneſtly beſeech you, that you would order a Copy of a Relation of the late fight as it really paſſed, to be delivered to us, and to permit us to ſend it to the States General of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, that by examining care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the relations of both Parties, the truth may the more eaſily be detected; That in the mean while, all Hoſtilities may ceaſe on both ſides. That the Negotiation for a Treaty of Peace, may not be broken off on this occaſion, That ſo by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying the misfortunes lately hapned, we may at laſt effect the concluſion of a ſolid and durable Peace, which we paſſionately wiſh for, and which we pray God the Soveraign Arbiter and Lord of Peace, to be pleaſed to grant us.</p>

            <p>After this diſcourſe, the Ambaſſadours retired, and were guarded home to their Lodgings by a Party of the Engliſh Guards. The Parliament ſeemed to them to be extremely divided, and to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29562:20"/> waver much in their Reſolutions about ſo weighty and Nice a Point, but yet without poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively declaring, which of the Admirals they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have begun the Fight. The major part of the Members maintained, that the Engliſh Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had right on his ſide, but <hi>Tromp</hi> was not of that opinion. The reſt of the Parliament being ſtirred up by the ſecret practices of the Spaniſh Faction, ſaid, that the Hollanders had by the late action given an evident proof of their Treachery; That the Republick of <hi>England</hi> had reaſon to be much alarmed at it, and to look upon it as an aſſured preſage of their future Ruine. Yet there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Members of that Illuſtrious Body, whether moved by ſome private intereſt, or by a principle of friendſhip, that were more inclined to an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with the Hollanders than to a Rupture, in the number of which, were theſe Gentlemen, <hi>viz. Mildmay, Vane, Pembrook,</hi> and ſeveral others: But <hi>Cromwel</hi> who was in the higheſt degree of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, of which he made his Idol, was the only man that had the ſecret of working upon the ſpirits of that Nation. His Party was backt by <hi>Harriſon, Whitlock, Bradſhaw, St. Johns, Harrington, Fleetwood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> who fomented the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and lying ſtories that the hatred the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had conceived againſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had lately produced, nay, and they had blown up the flame to ſo great a height, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that <hi>Tromp</hi> was come to <hi>London</hi> with a deſign to make a general Maſſacre of the people; but his enterpriſe not taking effect, he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thoſe of his Fleet, to put all the Engliſh they met with to the Sword; and that beſides, he had given orders to all his Captains upon pain of Death, that at the approach of any Engliſh Man of War, if they found themſelves in danger of being taken, having got all their Seamen upon the Deck, they ſhould clap a lighted Match into their Powder-room, as well to deſtroy their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29562:21"/> by blowing them up into the Air, as to take from them all hopes of any Booty. The Sieur <hi>Nieuport</hi> who was ſent ſome weeks before, as well to carry ſome Papers to the Ambaſſadors concerning their Negotiation, as to tell them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things by word of mouth that were intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with him by the States, run great danger of his life, becauſe he was taken for a Spie. In a word, the mutual hatred between both Nations was riſen to that high degree of bitterneſs, that there was reaſon to fear they would never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled more.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadors well obſerved, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> acting like an able Politition, uſed great diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with them, and that beſides, other motives that actuated him, he was further influenced by his own private Ambition. He appeared the firſt days of the conteſt very moderate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and wholly inclined to lay, by ſome gentle expedient, the Storm that was newly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, but yet at the bottom, he was of the ſame mind with the Parliament, or to ſpeak more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, 'twas he that underhand ſpurred them on to Revenge, and he that perſwaded them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their Forces to deſtroy the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> The Ambaſſadors having then diſcovered the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments deſign, and that they were fitting out a formidable Fleet to Sea, on which were to be embarkt 4000 Soldiers, reſolved to preſent a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Memorial to the Council of State, which was conceived in theſe Terms.</p>

And therefore the ſaid Ambaſſadors come again to day, to give you new aſſurances upon their having received by yeſterdays Poſt, all the informations given in from the 22d to the 29th of the laſt month, New ſtile, concerning the Battle in Queſtion, by which it appears ſtill more clearly, That the States had no hand in that action, directly or indirectly, declaring themſelves ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a ſtrict Alliance that may be capable to unite the two Republicks by eternal and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable friendſhip. It is certain, That is their laſt and moſt ſincere intention.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the ſaid Ambaſſadors pray the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State to be pleaſed to give them a ſpeedy Anſwer, ſuch as they in their prudence ſhall think moſt proper, in the preſent juncture, to prevent the miſchievous conſequences of ſome more diſmal Accident. Neither will it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, to acquaint the Council that the Sieur <hi>Newport</hi> ſent from their High and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſes to their Ambaſſadors for buſineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Negotiation, is upon his departure to repaſs the Sea, if the Council of State will pleaſe to grant him a Paſſport, as we pray them to do, and that he may have leave to chuſe one of the States Ships that is now in the <hi>Thames,</hi> or elſewhere.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Sieur <hi>Newport</hi> having expedited his affairs, waited only for a Paſſport to be gone, but he found great difficulty to obtain it, which retarded his departure for ſeveral days. He got at laſt out of <hi>London</hi> with much ado, and came to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> thinking to embark there. But at that time, the Engliſh, by ſhewing freſh marks of their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29562:22"/> rekindled thoſe flames which were thought to be half extinguiſht, and made appear by their ſlighting the inſtances of the Ambaſſadors, and by new acts of Hoſtility, that all thoſe troubles would ſoon degenerate into an open War. The Channel was full of their Privateers, who took without any diſtinction all manner of Ships that came in their way, without excepting even thoſe that belonged to <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi> All the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships that were in the <hi>Thames,</hi> were likewiſe ſtopt the 13th of <hi>June,</hi> and their Captains went to <hi>Chelſey,</hi> to make their Complaints of it to the Ambaſſadors, who were extremely ſurprized at all theſe new attempts, and thought it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon neceſſary to preſent yet a Third Memorial more, which they did the very ſame day, in theſe following Terms.</p>

'Twas for that effect they have called a ſolemn and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly of all the Members of the State, in which we not at all doubt, but with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Heaven, they will find out the true means to renew again that ancient Friendſhip and Union that has always reigned between the two

Their High and Mightineſſes deſire it with ſo much the more Paſſion and Earneſtneſs, becauſe it ſo highly concerns the Welfare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the two Republicks, and will effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtop the fountains of Chriſtian Blood that has been ſhed.

               <p>The Parliament of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> reflecting upon all the proofs of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and ſincere Friendſhip, they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given to the States General of the United Provinces, even from the firſt beginning of the troubles of this Kingdom, having omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what might conduce to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a perfect Correſpondence between them
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29562:23"/> and it, and render their union much more ſtrict than ever before, find themſelves at preſent hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly offended by an unexpected attempt, which is an act of Hoſtility committed upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> againſt the Fleet of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, after a mature deliberation, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Writings which their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies the Ambaſſadors of the United Provinces have put into our Hands, we have thought fit to make them the preſent Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Tho the Parliament were inclined out of a principle of affection and tenderneſs, to receive favourably the expreſſions contained in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid writings, tending to repreſent the late Fight between the two Fleets, as a thing that hapened without the knowledge and againſt the will of their High and Mightineſſes, yet upon due reflection made thereon, it appears, That the Reſolutions of the States; and the Conduct of their Admirals do no ways agree with all thoſe proteſtations, eſpecially in a time whilſt a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Alliance was managing, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had ſought for, and which had been Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated by their own Ambaſſadors. Beſides, what could be the ſcope of ſo formidable an Arming of 150 Ships of War, made by them without any occaſion for it, was it not for the deſign which has now lately broken out? Which is nothing elſe but the effect of a real jealouſie, even by the confeſſion of the Ambaſſadors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at the ſame time they pretend to excuſe themſelves of it; and according to the Tenour of the Commiſſions their High and Mightineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have given to the Chief Commanders of their Naval Armies, there are but too many reaſons that perſwade us to believe, that the States do thereby but aſpire to Raviſh from <hi>England</hi> by force of Arms, her ancient Prerogatives, and the Rights ſhe has over the Seas; and that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they aim at nothing elſe but the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29562:23"/> of our Fleet; which is our Barrier, and our ſecureſt Rampart, and by that means to expoſe this Commonwealth to an Invaſion, as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do by the late attempt. Upon which, the Parliament think themſelves indiſpenſably engaged with the aſſiſtance of Heaven to exact ſpeedy ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the outrages done to the Nation, and to put themſelves in ſuch a condition that the like may happen no more for the future. And yet they do all this with deſign however to appeaſe if poſſible the Troubles that have lately riſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations, by all ways of Humanity and moderation, if God who by his Wiſdom and Almighty Power, is able to do all things, ſhall pleaſe to furniſh us with more proper and efficacious means for that end, than have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto employed.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Anſwer, together with that proud and haughty way the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have with them, begun to give new alarms to <hi>Holland,</hi> and make her fear the Conſequences would be fatal. It was a very ſenſible Vexation to the States, to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the point of coming to a Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that New Republick, whoſe happy progreſſes in her beginnings had made them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive fair hopes, that ſhe would let her Allie <hi>Holland</hi> ſhare with her in the proſperities ſhe enjoyed by the good Correſpondence and ſtrict Friendſhip which was like to Reign between them. The Merchants were almoſt out of their Wits at it, by reaſon of the great loſs they daily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered both of their Ships and Goods, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily became a Prey to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Privateers. Which obliged the States, before the Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on already begun was quite broken off, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch another Extraordinary Ambaſſage to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> being willing to appeaſe all diſputes by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micable ways, if it were poſſible to find out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means to do it, and it being neceſſary for that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29562:24"/> purpoſe to make choice of ſome perſon of great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they caſt their Eyes upon Mr. <hi>Pauw,</hi> Lord of <hi>Heemſted,</hi> Penſioner of <hi>Holland,</hi> one of the ableſt Miniſters, even by the Teſtimony of Foreigners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Republick ever had. He ſet out from the <hi>Hague,</hi> the 25th. of <hi>June,</hi> on his way to the <hi>Brill,</hi> and at 6 a Clock at Night the ſame day he got on Board a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War; the 28th. he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and ſent notice of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to the States Ambaſſadors, and to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who were not a little ſurpriſed at it. The Ambaſſadors came preſently to him, to inform him of all that had paſs'd. The 30th. Mr. <hi>Heem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi> was Conducted to <hi>London</hi> with the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies uſual at the Entry of Ambaſſadors. He was received at the Tower, by three members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and Conducted thence by them to the Houſe appointed for his Lodging attended by a very fine Train of Coaches of many great Lords and perſons of Quality. He preſently demanded Audience of the Parliament, which being granted him the very next day, he there pronounced a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in <hi>Latin</hi> whereof here follows the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

But becauſe, by reaſon of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29562:24"/> inconſtancy of worldly things, there often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unlucky accidents and diſorders in Humane life, that change the State of affairs, and ſeem to cover over its face with a thick and ſable Cloud that obſcures for a time that agreeable Union, and happy mutual Benevolence, there is need of a great deal of precaution to ſtop its miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences; above all, if it be conſidered, that when ſuch kind of troubles are timely ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled in their birth, and that unhappy miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſtarted by them comes once to ceaſe, it may be ſaid, they ſerve more to ſtrengthen and confirm that mutual Union, than any way to weaken or diſſolve its Bonds.</p>
                  <p>'Tis for this deſign, that my Mrs. the States General of the United provinces, have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſend me in Quality of their Ambaſſador ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to the Parliament of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England,</hi> tho' otherwiſe they had no reaſon to doubt either of the Prudence or of the Capacity of the Ambaſſadors they had here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for Affairs of high importance. I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent, to aſſure the Commonwealth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from them, of the ſincere and inviolable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they have to ſee its Government continue in that Peace, Happineſs and Proſperity which at preſent it enjoys, and to offer it at the ſame time, all the ſervices they are capable of. And I can give you this Teſtimony of them with the more aſſured fidelity, becauſe having always been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in their aſſemblies, and coming now but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of them, I have been an Eye witneſs of the zeal and ardent paſſion they have, to contribute all that lies in their power, that may poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the maintaining a firm and ſolid Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between the two States, and to prevent all that may ſhake it. And therefore 'twas with great Aſtoniſhment, and with a very ſenſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret they heard of what has paſt between the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals of the two Republicks; and for fear that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29562:25"/> fatal Rencounter altogether unexpected ſhould cauſe ſome new miſ-underſtandings and raiſe new Jealouſies, or that by putting a ſtop to the preſent Treaty, it might make it impracticable to come to a concluſion of a Renovation of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Amity that has always been between the two Nations, the States, my Mrs. judg'd it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary I ſhould come hither, becauſe having been always preſent at all their deliberations by reaſon of my Employment, I was beſt able to Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked truth, and all the Circumſtances of that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they have been related to them, in order to the raſing out all ſuſpicions that might be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſtemper or deſtroy the good intelligence and true Amity that is between the two Nations, and remove all obſtacles that might, hinder the concluſion of the Treaty already began.</p>
                  <p>Moreover I proteſt and declare in the preſence of the Parliament of the Republick of <hi>England</hi> by vertue of my Credential Letters; and in the Name of the States General, my Mrs. that they never had any thoughts to attempt any thing, or give order, that any thing ſhould be attempted that might give any juſt cauſe of Umbrage to the Sovereign power of this Commonwealth, to break or weaken the Union and good Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence that has been ſo long cultivated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Republicks, or under what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſoever, to ſow any diſcord between them. But rather on the contrary, I can ſay, that the States have been moved by their own inclinations, and by the ſentiments of a real Friendſhip, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſtudy out all that might conduce to the haſtning the concluſion of a ſtrict and inviolable Alliance between the two Nations. It's true a very conſiderable Fleet was Equip'd in <hi>Holland,</hi> but at the ſame time there's no body but knows, the States were forced ſo to do by the continual complaints of their Subjects, and that they gave
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29562:25"/> notice of it to the Parliament. And they publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beforehand, that this arming was for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end than for the liberty and ſecurity of Commerce, which was much endamag'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by many very ſenſible Loſſes the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the United Provinces daily ſuffered of their Ships and Goods; and certainly, it is but natural to make uſe of the means that force and neceſſity put into our hands, to protect oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed innocence: But they thoughr of nothing leſs than a fight, to create new troubles between the two Nations, and Revive the diſputes that were already terminated. But things being ſo, and there hapning by accident a fierce Battle between the Fleets of the two Nations, the States General have thought fit to Communicate to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> an exact and faithfull Relation of all that paſſed, ſuch as they have received from their Admiral, authorized by the Teſtimony of all the Captains and other perſons worthy of Credit: namely, that Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Fleet of this Republick, more by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity than out of any premeditated deſign, and that after he had paid his Civilities to Major <hi>Bourn,</hi> as he was purſuing his voyage, he fell into the preſence of Admiral <hi>Blake</hi> before he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware; that preſently he ordered an advice Boat to be made ready, to ſend ſome Officers of the Fleet to Compliment him, but that <hi>Blake</hi> anſwering him with Civilities of a quite contrary nature, let flie all his Guns at him, and that then <hi>Tromp</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd his, more to defend himſelf, than to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Aggreſſor. This was the cauſe of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, in which, the Capricious humour of Fortune had more ſhare than any deſign of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil premeditated, and ſwell'd up with Ambition, ſo that it being begun about a miſtaken point of Honour, and not continued by our men out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny principle of animoſity, the States General pray the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29562:26"/> they had no hand in that Action, but to take it for an Event of pure chance, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of Worldly affairs, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they would be pleaſed to recall their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Commiſſions, and to let all Acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility ceaſe that now diſturb Commerce, and the States on their part, are ready to conſent to the ſame, and always to employ all poſſible means to facilitate an Accommodation.</p>
                  <p>They are very ſenſible, that all Chriſtendom is deeply concerned in ſo great an affair as this, and eſpecially the reformed Churches of all <hi>Europe,</hi> who all equally wiſh and deſire, that our troubles may be ſtifled in their Birth, as being perſwaded, that diſcord ariſing between Neighbouring States of the ſame Religion, may not only draw after it the Ruin of that Commerce that makes them Flouriſh, but likewiſe awaken the drooping hopes of both their ſecret and open Enemies, who would not fail to take occaſion thereupon, to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſome new Plots in ſome Province or other of this Commonwealth which would afterwards break out, and ſo paſſing from one to another, we ſhould ſee our States become the bloody Theater of a War. To prevent therefore and put a ſtop to the Courſe of ſo great miſchiefs, I have Orders without further delay, to Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you, and employ all my induſtry that ſome aſſur'd means may be agreed upon on both ſides to accommodate the differences about what has paſt, and for the taking ſuch juſt Meaſures for the future, that there may never happen the like accidents again between the two Fleets; and that ſo thereby the Greatneſs and Glory of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> may be ſecured from the danger of all ſorts of attempts againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Since then the States General openly declare to the Parliament the ardent paſſion they have to ſee the two Nations perfectly United toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and their differences entirely compoſed, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29562:26"/> that the propoſitions on both ſides may at laſt terminate in a ſtrict Alliance, all the favour I deſire of the Parliament, is that they would pleaſe to give order to their Commiſſioners, and to the Council of State, to give me ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Audience, and to labour joyntly with me for the Concluſion of the Treaty, in order to terminate the principal buſineſs that is the foundation of my Negotiation, as well as of that of the other Ambaſſadors In extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of the States.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, I acknowledge my ſelf infinitely obliged to the Parliament, that they have been pleaſed to grant a Ship to Mr. <hi>Nieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> to repaſs the Sea, and go into <hi>Holland;</hi> I will add here, that being a Member of the State, he has had order to remain with me, to aſſiſt me with his Council, till my return, which I dare be confident, the Parliament will not take ill; and that they will be pleaſed favourably to accept my moſt humble ſervices which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>de Heemſted</hi> going the next day to the Council of State,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>de Heemſted</hi>'s Speech to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State.</note> made them the following Speech, which he pronounced in <hi>French.</hi> Since it has pleaſed my Lor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s, the States General of the United Provinces beſides the Ambaſſadors they have already here, to ſend me extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in the ſame Quality to the Parliament of the Republick of <hi>England,</hi> to whom I had the Honour yeſterday in a full Aſſembly, to declare the Subject of my Ambaſſage, and the ſincerity of the intentions of the High and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lords, my Mrs. I thought my ſelf indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably obliged to appear before this <hi>Auguſt</hi> Council, as well to preſent them my Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Letters, as to aſſure them for my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, how much I tender the proſperity they enjoy in the management of thoſe great and important affairs intruſted to them by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29562:27"/> and which they diſcharge with ſo much Wiſdom and Prudence. And as I have already declared to the Parliament, ſo I Reiterate again here, that the States General deſire nothing ſo much as the Continuation of a good, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Correſpondence, and the Renewing of a durable and ſolid Friendſhip with <hi>England,</hi> of which they had in ſeveral Rencounters given very ſignal marks. It is Certain, the States, my Mrs. wiſh nothing more heartily, than to ſee the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace brought to a Concluſion, and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between the two Republicks, thereby Re-eſtabliſht and Corroborated, and all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of hatred and miſ-underſtanding that might be able to diſturb it, thereby entirely diſpell'd. Gentleman, it is the Aim of the Enemies of the Reformation, by Diviſions, not only to weaken but totally to ruin the two Republicks, but the two Nations having received ſo many great marks of the bleſſing of God, as well by their par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taking in the true Religion of which they are the truſty Guardians, as by the prodigies that have appear'd in their foundation and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſeveral parts of the World, whither they have ſo happily advanced Commerce in ſpite of all the dangers of the Seas; the States, my Mrs. Judge it abſolutely neceſſary to maintain Religion, and ſtrengthen our Republicks which cannot be effected otherwiſe than by a happy Complication, and an agreeable confuſion of their Riches and common Intereſts; that will be the true means with the aſſiſtance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to prevent all that may be capable to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their happineſs and felicity.</p>
                  <p>Upon which conſiderations the States General were ſo extremely ſurprized at the news of what paſt lately between the two Naval Armies, and at the mutual jealouſie the two Nations have conceived thereupon, That they thought it moſt highly important, to depute me extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29562:27"/> towards the Parliament of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> and towards this Venerable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to repreſent to them the true State of things, ſo much the rather, becauſe having the honour to aſſiſt in two Aſſemblies, namely that of the States General, and of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Frieſland,</hi> I have a full knowledge of their moſt ſecret and moſt weighty Affairs, and that by conſequence, I am able to aſſure them, that there never was any Project form'd, any Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken, nor any Commiſſion given directly or indirectly, to offend the Republick of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to give them any juſt Cauſe of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, and much leſs, to go and attack their Fleets: But rather on the contrary, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. That whereſoever our Men ſhould meet with thoſe of that Nation, they ſhould treat them as true Friends; tho in the fatal rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have newly mentioned, things hapned quite otherwiſe, of which I gave yeſterday a Relation ample and particular enough to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at preſent, becauſe it is not convenient to be ſo often Renewing the Memory of paſt things that ought to be buried in eternal oblivion, in the mean while, finding by the laſt anſwer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to our Ambaſſadors, that you pretend ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for what is paſt, and aſſurances for the future; and beſides the States, my Mrs. Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it Requiſite firſt to remove all preventions and miſtaken prejudices concerning what is paſt; and that the two Republicks ſhould endeavour to find out means to ſecure them againſt the like accidents for the time to come, that the Treaty of Alliance already in good forwardneſs be without interruption, carried on, that beſides, the ſureſt means imaginable be provided to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all ſuſpicion and diſtruſt, and that a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order be eſtabliſht according to which the Naval Armies on both ſides ſhall be obliged to Regulate themſelves, concerning which points I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29562:28"/> have received the neceſſary inſtructions from my Mrs. I intreat you Gentlemen, to be pleaſed to name ſome of your Illuſtrious Body, to treat with me out of hand concerning the affairs in Queſtion. I muſt add to all I have juſt now aſſerted, that the States never had any thoughts to diſpute with the Republick of <hi>England,</hi> that Grandure and Sovereign power that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes it with ſo much Glory from all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Republicks of <hi>Europe;</hi> Heartily wiſhing beſides, that by the Union of two ſuch potent States as <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Holland,</hi> the two Republicks may contribute to the mutual preſervation of one another, be ſecured againſt the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their Enemies, and aſſure to themſelves a firm and laſting Peace. In the mean while I pray you to give order by your Wiſe Conduct as ſoon as poſſible, that the miſchief cauſed by that unfortunate Rencounter, may not be increaſed by new Hoſtilities committed againſt the Ships of the States; but rather that you would ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid the ſame, without ſtaying till the ſore be grown incurable, and till by that, we awake the drooping hopes of our Enemies; being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that we ſhall find out effectual means to reconcile us, to the ſhame and confuſion of thoſe that are jealous of our proſperity and common fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the 29th. the Council of State having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined all theſe Reaſons,<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of States Anſwer.</note> gave the following an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>Heemſted,</hi> viz. <hi>That he might well enough ſee what was the intention of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the anſwer given to the three Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the other Ambaſſadors, before his arrival, ſince nothing had been propoſed ſince, neither by him nor any other, that was capable to make the Parliament change their Reſolution; that if the attempt made by the</hi> Holland <hi>Fleet, as much by ſurprize as it was had ſucceeded according to their hopes, it might have been ſaid, that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of</hi> England <hi>would have ſeen it ſelf plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the greateſt diſaſters imaginable, and that therefore it was not reaſonable, after they had been ſo miraculouſly preſerved, they ſhould expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again to the like diſgraces for the future. That they could not ſuffer themſelves to be any longer amuſed under the ſpecious pretence of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen, or by Examples not pertinent to their Caſe,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29562:30"/> of what other States may have done; but that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were reſolved to employ thoſe means which neceſſity and the Nature of the Fact Require to be uſed; that beſides, they could not conſent to the Concluſion of a Treaty of Alliance, till they had received ſatisfaction about the point in Queſtion, and that as to the demonſtrations of a ſincere and real Friendſhip from their High and Mightineſſes, which their Ambaſſadors ſo much boaſted of: The</hi> Engliſh <hi>on their ſide likewiſe had no leſs reaſon to value themſelves upon the Authentick proofs they have given of the like to the</hi> Hollanders, <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in general or particular; and that in a word, they could not change any thing in the Anſwer they had already given them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>de Heemſted</hi> having received this Anſwer, demanded on the 1ſt. of <hi>July</hi> a new Conference, in which he Renewed his inſtances, by declaring, <hi>That there never had paſt any thing on the States ſide that was capable to give any juſt cauſe of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to the</hi> Engliſh; <hi>That they had propoſed an aſſured way, to prevent all ſorts of Contestation, and to diſcover the truth, but that they would not follow it, and that a Manifest injuſtice was done to his Mrs. That it was very eaſie to Judge of that by the refuſal the States had made to their Subjects, notwithſtanding the preſſing ſolicitations uſed by them for that purpoſe, to grant them any Letters of Repriſal; that laſtly to ſhew, they were wholly inclined to Peace, they had promiſed their Protection to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Company at</hi> Rotterdam; <hi>that if the</hi> Engliſh <hi>perſiſted to Reject all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable means to procure an Accommodation, it would cauſe a great Conſternation amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of</hi> Holland; <hi>That in fine, he therefore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Council of State, to be pleaſed to propoſe ſome other means themſelues, and in the mean while, to forbid all Acts of Hoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:29562:30"/> ſeeing they neglected to give him an anſwer; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered another writing to the Councel of State, by which he Repreſented the Eminent danger that threatned the two Republicks, by the miſchiefs that would undoubtedly follow upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to accept the means he had propoſed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he deſired them to propoſe ſome other of their own if it were poſſible, that might be more effectual.</p>
            <p>The Parliament could no longer Recoil,<note place="margin">Articles propoſed to the <hi>Dutch</hi> by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but at laſt propoſed the following Articles as a ground for the Re-eſtabliſhment of a Peace: <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the States General of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces ſhould be obl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That theſe two Conditions being firſt agreed to, and put in Execution, they would proceed to a Treaty of Alliance which ſhould ſtraightly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite the two Republicks together, render their intereſts common, and their Friendſhip perpetual, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, and that for this effect, the Parliament would be always Ready to accept all juſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ways propoſed to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador of the States being aſtoniſh'd at ſuch an anſwer, demanded on the 6th. of <hi>July</hi> a new Conference, wherein he Repreſented, <hi>That their High and Mightineſſes had been obliged to make an Extroardinary armament, and to be at Exceſſive Expences for the Reaſons he had already mentioned; that their Subjects had ſuffered conſiderable damages by the taking of a great many</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> French <hi>Ships; that the States
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29562:31"/> and their Merchant Subjects ſtill felt the loſſes that had been cauſed to them, that if they would needs ſtand upon the point of indemnifying, they needed only to compare the loſſes of the one Nation with thoſe of the other, to be convinced, that the States General had been the greateſt ſufferers, which would be eaſy to demonſtrate, provided the buſineſs were not ſpun out to too great a length, by an over Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſcuſſion; That if the ſaid Commiſſioners would on their ſide make a juſt and Reaſonable eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, It would then plainly appear, that the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of their High and Mightineſſes is to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate things by an amicable way. As concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Treaty of Confederacy, between the two Republicks, and the mutual aſſiſtance they might afford one another upon occaſion, in caſe their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemies ſhould go about to attempt upon their liberty, the States other Ambaſſadors had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently before explain'd the intentions of their Mrs. upon that Subject, being always ready to purſue the ſaid Treaty, if it would be conſented to: That if the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhould think fit to render that Treaty more ample and Authentick, it would be a very agreeable thing to him, and that he paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately deſired they would pleaſe to give him all poſſible inſtruction imaginable thereupon. That more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he thought it would be highly important if not very neceſſary, that orders ſhould be given to the two Fleets not to come near one another, and that they might not come to any new Engagements, as 'twas to be feared they otherwiſe would; And that beſides that, he inſiſted, that they would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay releaſe the Ships that were ſeized, that ſo their Spirits being once calmed, the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The 7th of <hi>July,</hi> the Sieur <hi>de Heemſted</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded another Conference in purſuance of the orders he had received from his Maſters, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that if the Republick of <hi>England</hi> would not openly declare themſelves, he would demand his Audience of Leave, and that with ſo much the more Juſtice; becauſe inſtead of an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which they had flatter'd themſelves, the Parliament had given orders to their Fleet, to deſtroy the <hi>Dutch</hi> Herring Fiſhery, and to ſink all <hi>Holland</hi> Ships, whilſt to the Northward they were watching for our Ships that were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Indies.</hi> He repreſented therefore in that Conference,</p>
            <q>That whilſt he was buſied in anſwering the Writing that was delivered him by Mr. <hi>Oliver Fleming</hi> from the Council of State, he had with much diſpleaſure been informed, that the Engliſh
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29562:32"/> Fleet was put to Sea, in order to ſome enterprize; That he had likewiſe received Letters, by which the States his Maſters had ordered him, that ſince he had uſed all his endeavours to no purpoſe, to obtain a Ceſſation of acts of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he ſhould demand his Audience of Leave, in order to return with all diligence into <hi>Holland,</hi> to give the States an account of his Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore in Obedience to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Mrs. he damanded, he might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to take his leave of the Council of State, the next day, and might for his Tranſportation make uſe of the man of War commanded by Captain <hi>John Verbaaf,</hi> in which he came into <hi>England.</hi> That the ſaid Captain might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a Paſsport, that he might not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted in his way by the Parliaments Ships: Adding, that becauſe the other Ambaſſadours had ſignified to him, that they had likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to retire, he deſired they might be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take their Audience of Leave at the ſame time, and to provide themſelves with Ships ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to tranſport their perſons and Equipages. The Council of State anſwered, That they were obliged firſt to make their Report to the Parliament who were to ſit the next day, or the <hi>Tuſeday</hi> following after the Memorial was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the States Ambaſſador Extraordinary to the Commiſſioners; And that till then they could give no other Anſwer to the ſaid Ambaſſador.</q>
            <p>But that on the 8th of <hi>July</hi> Mr <hi>de Heemſted</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Council of State, two Memorials: The firſt of which was conceived in theſe Terms.</p>
            <q>The Ambaſſadour Extraordinary of the States,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Heem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted</hi>'s firſt Memorial.</note> having ſeen the Anſwer given by the Council to his laſt Propoſition, has thought fit to declare a new that he intended as ſoon as he came back into <hi>Holland,</hi> in conſequence of the Overture made to him for that purpoſe, to apply his whole endeavours to find out ſome
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29562:32"/> proper means for the Reuniting the two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſſipating all the Umbrages that ſeemed then to render them irreconcilable, that having at length attained to that happy Union ſo neceſſary for their common Security, there might be no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing able to diſturb them: And as that Reſolution was full of ſincerity, and aimed only at the tranquility and happineſs of the two Republicks, ſo it was accordingly expedient, to prevent by a diligent execution, ſome Evils that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would grow incurable, if they were not ſtopt in their very Source, That upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, he requeſted, the Council would be pleaſed to order, he might be ſpeedily diſpatcht, by granting him his Audience of Leave, and the neceſſary Paſsports for his Ship that waited for him at <hi>Graveſend;</hi> and that being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That the Council of State would have regard to his Quality and Character, he dar'd to flatter himſelf, they would render him the ſame Honours at his Audience of Leave as were done him at his Entry, and for which he was very much obliged to the Council.</q>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">The other Memorial imported,<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial.</note> that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador Extraordinary of the States found it neceſſary to Repreſent to the Council, That if they thought it fit, after he ſhould have made his Report to their High and Mightineſſes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Secretary, or ſome other truſty Perſon, might come back to <hi>London,</hi> to maintain a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence together, whether by delivering or receiving to and from the two States, all that might any way conduce to the re-eſtabliſhing a ſtrict Alliance and perfect Union between them: And that in order thereunto, it would pleaſe the Council, to Grant the neceſſary Paſsport for the ſecurity of that Perſon; That he ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have permiſſion to ſtay at <hi>London</hi> ſo long as the Parliament, or the States ſhould think fit; or elſe that the Council would name ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29562:33"/> themſelves, whom they thought fit to receive the Letters that ſhould be written to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to ſolicit their Anſwers.</q> But they made no Reply to this laſt Propoſal, how equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſoever it appeared, as being jealous that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Covert ſome Dangerous Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence might be carried on againſt them in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the pretenſions of the Family of the <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts.</hi> The three other Ambaſſadors preſented like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Council of State the following Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, on the 8th of <hi>July. That ſince the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of the States General had Orders by the laſt Letters they received, to Retire without delay, to go and give an account of their Negotiation to the States their Maſters, they therefore prayed the Council, they might be permitted to take their Audience of Leave of that Auguſt Aſſembly, and that accordingly Ships neceſſary for their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation and that of their reſpective Equipages, together with Paſſports for their ſecurity might be granted them; adding, that there were ſome Ships of their Nation ready for that purpoſe, as Captain</hi> de Boet, <hi>and three other Ships of</hi> Dort.</p>
            <p>The Republick of <hi>England</hi> fortifying every day more and more their Authority, began to render themſelves inſupportable, by their exceſſive Pride and Haughtineſs. For <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Hanſe-Towns of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and other Free Cities of <hi>Europe</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to acknowledge their up-ſtart Government. And they troubled themſelves not much about the States Ambaſſadors, as the ſcornful diſdain they ſhewed of all their Remonſtrances was a viſible proof, ſo that no body was ſurprized at all to ſee with what facility they granted them their Audience of Leave. They conſented that two of their Men of War ſhould Convoy them, and two other Ships Tranſport their Equipages. And ſo the next day the fear Ambaſſadors were conducted to their Audience, and Mr. <hi>de Heemſted</hi> made
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29562:33"/> the following Diſcourſe, in the name of them all.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The States General of the United Provinces have ſent their Ambaſſadors Extraordinary to the Parliament of the Republick of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>de Heemſted</hi>'s Speech at his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Leave.</note> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by all ſorts of ways to induce them to renew the ancient Amity between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to confirm more ſtraitly their Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. They were followed a little while after by Mr. <hi>Nieuport</hi> a Member of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſtfrieſland</hi> who was ſent to clear ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and to give a more Authentick proof of their Good Intentions concerning the Treaty of Confederacy.</p>
               <p>In fine, it pleaſed their High and Mightineſſes ſome days after, to make yet another Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Deputation, and to make choice of me for that, with Expreſs Order to come and give the Republick of <hi>England,</hi> new, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſtronger Aſſurances of a faithfull and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Amity, in order to diſpel all Umbrages and all Subjects of miſunderſtanding, and to prevent all Obſtacles that might hinder the Execution of ſo laudable a Deſign.</p>
               <p>For that effect, it was propoſed. That an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry ſhould be made by ſome judicious perſons on both ſides, into the Action that lately paſſed between the two Fleets, and which happened not by any premeditated deſign, but by pure acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that ſo according to their Verdict, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction might be given to the Party offended. For we Proteſt before God, and before Men, and in preſence of the Parliament of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>England,</hi> That the States our Maſters never had it in their thoughts, to offend this Republick, and much leſs to commit any act of Hoſtility againſt it. But that they were more diſpoſed by a ſence of a true and ſincere affection, to contribute to the maintaining a ſtable and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29562:34"/> good underſtanding and inviolable Peace between them.</p>
               <p>But ſince unfortunately in ſpite of the ſteps that have been made, and the pains taken, to pacifie all theſe Troubles, the two Ambaſſages have proved ineffectual, and fruſtrated of the hopes they had with ſo much juſtice conceived, and that, by new Diſputes that have ariſen and cauſed great loſſes; and that beſides, the States are threatned with new Hoſtilities from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Fleet, without having had the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given them of it: The Ambaſſadors thought themſelves obliged in prudence to prevent the Storm, and to retire into their own Country, as well to go and give an account of their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, as to take new Inſtructions from the States their Maſters. For this end, we preſent our ſelves all together before this Auguſt Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to give them notice, That we have received order to retire, and are upon the point of our departure.</p>
               <p>We have already repreſented to the Council of State what things are neceſſary for our departure, with Reſpect to the Juncture of time and our Character, and we wait their Anſwer.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, it is not only our Duty but a point of Juſtice to intreat you, that all our Ships that have been brought into the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> or been ſtopt there before the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Declaration of War, without any offence given by any of the Maſters of the ſaid Ships, may at laſt be releaſed with all their Men, that they may purſue their intended Voyages, without being moleſted in any manner whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and that all be done according to our ancient Friendſhip, and the Law of Nations practiſed among Chriſtians. We hope the Juſtice of the Soveraign Republick of <hi>England</hi> will not refuſe us a demand ſo equitable as this.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:29562:34"/>
               <p>Moreover, we Implore the Protection of Heaven, and beſeech God, the Author of Peace, that he will pleaſe of his Goodneſs to inſpire the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of this Republick with ſuch Sentiments as may induce them to a Speedy Reconciliation with the States of the United Provinces, for the maintenance of the Reformation whoſe firmeſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and moſt ſolid foundation has always been Peace, in the Boſom of which it Flouriſhes, and quietly enjoys Proſperity, and which, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if our Troubles ſhould continue any longer, would ſee it ſelf brought to an inevitable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and plunged into the greateſt Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. We ſtill pray God to be pleaſed to avert the Courſe of the Miſchiefs and Calamities that accompany War; and to pour forth his precious Bleſſings upon the two Republicks.</p>
               <p>And as we are ordered to retire forthwith into <hi>Holland,</hi> we ſhall accordingly take leave of this Illuſtrious Aſſembly, with all imaginable thanks for the kindneſſes we have received from them, in full confidence, that they will not refuſe us the things we have already demanded of them, and which are every where granted to Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, in regard to their Character, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their Perſons.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we recommend to you the <hi>Dutch</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants reſiding at <hi>London,</hi> or elſewhere within this Kingdom, that their Goods and Perſons may be taken into the Protection of the Parliament.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Theſe were the ſteps made by the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the United Provinces, to prevent a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with <hi>England,</hi> by which, all the world may judge, how great the Power of that new hatcht State was, tho ſcarcely yet fledg'd, to make them ſo Courted by a Nation that at that juncture, more fear'd than lov'd them, and how great and preſumptuous their pride was too, in refuſing ſuch fair offers and venturing to engage in a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29562:35"/> War with ſo potent an Enemy, as the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> when their own ſettlement at home was ſo unſecure.

               <hi>Tromp</hi> having received Expreſs Orders from the States, who found themſelves obliged to make uſe of Reprizals, not to ſpair the <hi>Engliſh</hi> any longer, but to do them all the miſchief he could, reſolved to go and attack <hi>Ayſchew.</hi> Vice Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Evertſz,</hi> had the Command of the Van, with a Squadron of 21 Ships of War; Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> Commanded the main Body of the Fleet, conſiſting of 30 Ships; and Rear Admiral <hi>Floriſz,</hi> the Rear, compoſed of 28 Men of War. But there happening a Calm, and after that a contrary Wind, it was impoſſible for them to execute that project. <hi>Tromp</hi> therefore ſteer'd his Courſe towards the North, in ſearch of <hi>Blake.

            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had already ſeized upon the Iſle of <hi>Inſeith,</hi> where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> uſed to water, and theſe, latter advancing towards the Coaſts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> arrived near <hi>Fulo</hi> and <hi>Fairhill,</hi> where they eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Blake,</hi> who was watching for our Ships com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back from the <hi>Indies.</hi> The two Fleets were diſpoſing themſelves for a Fight, when in the night between the 5th and 6th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Skie grew dark by little and little, and ſoon after there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain preſages of a violent Tempeſt:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tromp</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed by a dreadful Tempeſt.</note> For the wind having long been ſhifting about, turned at laſt to the <hi>N. N. Weſt,</hi> and blew with ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity, that our Sails were all rent and torn in pieces, and the Waves rowl'd through them, and ſo went and ſpent themſelves againſt the Rocks of <hi>Hitland,</hi> throwing their Fome up to the very Heaven. Thus the Fleet being as 'twere buried by the violence of the Sea, in moſt horrible Abyſſes, roſe out of them only to be toſt up to the very Clouds. Here the Maſts were beaten down into the Sea, there the Deck was over-flown by the prevailing Waves: Here the Tempeſt was ſo much Miſtreſs of the Ships, that they could be no longer governed, and on another ſide, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared all the doleful fore-runners of a diſmal Wrack. And the Darkneſs increaſing the danger, and the confuſed cries of the Mariners redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the common fear, both together made the ſaddeſt and moſt frightful ſpectacle, that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen.</p>
            <p>When the day was come, the diſorder was clearly diſcovered: Two Ships were found ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in between two Rocks, and the Shattered Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of three Fireſhips, that were ſeparated from the Fleet by the violence of the Waves, left no

But Providence that preſides over all Events ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theſe Evils to our men, by the happy arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of three <hi>Indian</hi> Ships, and of ſeveral others that were coming from the Iſlands call'd, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilles,</hi> who unexpectedly fell into our Fleet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome put into <hi>Schalloway,</hi> others made to the South-Weſt of <hi>Hitland,</hi> ſome others to the Weſt, and the reſt to the North of the ſame Iſland. In the mean while <hi>Tromp</hi> went before, ſailing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> with a Fleet of 39 ſail, and one of the Ships come from the <hi>Indies;</hi> And in the Latitude of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he diſcovered <hi>Blake</hi> with 62 Great Ships much leſs damaged then his own, becauſe that by a great happineſs for him, the Tempeſt having driven him to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Hitland,</hi> he found on that ſide, more Shelter, as ſoon as <hi>Tromp</hi> eſpied him, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to ſtay for his coming up to him, with intention to preſent him battle. But <hi>Blake</hi> either being loath to loſe the Weather-Gage, or for ſome other Reaſons unknown, would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. Soon after, obſerving that <hi>Tromp</hi> was ſheer'd off into the main Sea, in order to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his firſt intended courſe, he likewiſe fell down towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> having done nothing with his ſo potent Fleet, but ſcattered the Herring Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, deſtroyed their Convoy, and taken two <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Ships that were cruizing in thoſe Seas, and which fell by chance into his Fleet, but who had firſt deſtroyed him two of his Frigats. The reſt of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet after they had ſpent ſome weeks in refitting, entred happily into the <hi>Vlie</hi> and the <hi>Texel</hi> at the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Tromp</hi> was out at Sea, the States General reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet out another Fleet, beſides, both to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Merchant Ships, render Navigation more Free, and put themſelves into a Condition the more powerfully to oppoſe the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution taken, they were next to ſeek for a Man

Some members of the State having repreſented to him, that his Country then ſtood in preſſing need of his Service, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that his intention was to live in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and to meddle no more with any Sea affairs. But they preſſed it to him again, telling him, that ſuch a man as he, that had given ſo many Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proofs of his Bravery, and of his Zeal for his Country, ought not now to refuſe at a dead lift, to give it the laſt marks of his ſtedfaſt affection that were deſired of him, eſpecially ſince, he would be only obliged to go as 'twere a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. So that at laſt he let himſelf be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and went on Board the Ship called the <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> carrying 28 Guns, and 134 Men. But the Fleet that was to aſſemble at <hi>Wielingen,</hi> was forced to ſtay ſome time for ſeveral Men of War which were at the <hi>Texel,</hi> and other Ports. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> being embark'd on board the <hi>Neptune,</hi> put to Sea, and arrived on the 10th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at the Fleet which was then but 15 ſail of Men of War, and 2 Fire-ſhips. Some days after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received a Reinforcement of 7 men of War and 2 Fire-ſhips, he ſet ſail towards the Strait of <hi>Callis,</hi> according to the Order he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the States for that effect. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was, to Convoy along the Channel the Merchant Fleet that was then in the <hi>Texel,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſet ſail to the Weſt-ward, and afterwards to Cruize about the Channel to pick up the Ships that were coming from divers parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and Conduct them into <hi>Holland.</hi> For that purpoſe Order was likewiſe given to the Merchant Fleet in the <hi>Texel,</hi> to ſpeed away to <hi>Wielingen,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29562:37"/> to joyn the Fleet of Men of War, or at leaſt to go and ſeek them out towards the Strait of <hi>Callis,</hi> or in the Channel. In the mean while <hi>De Ruiter</hi> received advice by two Boats la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with <hi>Dutch</hi> Priſoners that had been taken on board ſome Ships that were ſtopt before the Rupture, but were diſcharged by the Parliament, that paſſing by near the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet between the Iſles of <hi>Wight</hi> and <hi>Portland,</hi> they found it 46 ſail ſtrong, of which about 12 were of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious bigneſs. <hi>De Ruiter,</hi> writ word of it to the Admiralty of <hi>Zealand</hi> complaining of the piteous condition in which he found the Ships of his Fleet, and Repreſenting to their High and Mightineſſes, that he needed greater Forces, to form any enterprize, and to attack the Enemy purſuant to the Orders he had received. He kept himſelf ſometimes below <hi>Swarteneſs,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Cruizing along the Channel, he advanc'd as far as the <hi>Cingles.</hi> During all which time, he ſent out from day to day, ſeveral light Frigats to inform themſelves of the Countenance of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to look out for the <hi>Texel</hi> Fleet. On the 21ſt. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 8 Men of War, and 50 Merchant Ships, under the Command of <hi>Gideon Verburg</hi> joyned <hi>De Ruiter</hi> Weſt-ward of <hi>Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> the ſame day he writ another very preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Letter to the States, in which he deſired them to ſend him ſome Ships of bigger Force, and better appointed for War, becauſe thoſe he had were very ill Equip'd, being not furniſh'd with half their Compliment of Guns and Men, eſpecially thoſe of the Province of <hi>Frieſland.</hi> The following days he paſſed the Strait of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> with the Merchant Fleet, and purſuing his way along the Channel, he advanced as far as the Latitude of <hi>Plymouth;</hi> but being near the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> on the 26th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> about 2 a Clock in the afternoon, the Wind at North-Eaſt, he perceived a Fleet of 45 ſail to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29562:38"/> of that of <hi>Holland. De Ruiter</hi> imagining preſently thereupon, that it was the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet Commanded by Admiral <hi>George Ayſchew,</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant Ships, tackt about, and ſtood directly towards Admiral <hi>Ayſchew,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet was compoſed of 40 Men of War, whereof 12 as we have ſaid, were of an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary bulk. For there were two of them of 60 Guns each, and 8 from 36 to 40, and beſides them 5 Fireſhips. <hi>De Ruiter</hi>'s Forces conſiſted of 30 ſmall Ships of War, and 6 Fire-ſhips. The greateſt of thoſe Ships had not on board above 30 Guns, excepting 2 of them, namly the <hi>Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Oſtritch</hi> that carried each of them 40, and that were Equiped by the care of the <hi>Indian</hi> Chamber of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for the Service of the State; and the others had not half their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of Men; beſides which diſadvantage, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was hampered with a Merchant Fleet of 60 ſail, who were the principal mark at which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> levelled their deſigns. Some days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had put all things in order, and divided his Fleet into 3 Squadrons, the firſt of which he himſelf Commanded, the ſecond was under the Conduct of <hi>Vanden Brock,</hi> in quality of Vice-Admiral; and the third was under that of <hi>Verbaaſ</hi> in quality of Rear-Admiral. To each Squadron, he had joyned 2 Fire-Ships, ordering them to keep themſelves in readineſs upon the approach of the Enemies, to go and ſet fire to the biggeſt of their Ships.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29562:38"/> had the advantage, 'tis to be preſumed, he would have entirely defeated them, eſpecially, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fire-Ships that had the Wind againſt them, could have come up with them.

            <p>The Night parted the Combatants, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> making their way into the main Sea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped to the Northward.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> loſs, according to their own report, was ſo very ſmall, that 'tis hardly to be believed, they having loſt none of their Ships, and having had but 50 or 60 men kill'd, and about as many wounded; whereas on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide, it is pretended according to the moſt faithfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, there were above a 1000 kill'd or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and two or three of their Ships loſt.</p>

Which undauntedneſs of their Captain, or rather the panick fear of an aſſured death, put ſuch freſh courage and vigour into thoſe cowardly wretches, that they promiſed him from that moment, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable obedience, adding, that they would fight to the laſt drop of their blood, and thereupon every one of them returning to his former poſt, and the brave <hi>Douve</hi> giving the Signal, he with but 24 Guns, attackt an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship of 40, and letting her come up juſt cloſe to his ſide, he fought her ſo to purpoſe, that he ſunk her with all her men; another Frigat of 50 Guns coming up likewiſe to him, was alſo ſunk, and after that again, a third coming to aſſault him, was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laboured, that ſhe had much ado to hold up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove water long enough to ſave her ſelf in the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> port ſhe could reach. It is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there were in the two firſt Ships that periſh'd above 800 perſons, very few of which were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. After the Battle, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> ſpent all the night in repairing the damages, the Ships of his Fleet had ſuffered; and that the Merchant Ships that were diſperſed from him during the Fight might be able the better to rejoyn him, he put up lights in four different places on Board his Ship. The next morning at break of day; the

               <hi>Hollanders</hi> having diſcovered the <hi>English</hi> Fleet at about 2 miles diſtance from them, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> Summoned all the Captains on Board him, to a Conſultation, in which 'twas reſolved, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Enemies till Noon, with deſign, in caſe they ſtopt not, to ſend back the Merchant Ships into their own Country.

            <q>The day following <hi>de Ruiter</hi> calling together all the Officers of the Fleet, told them,<note place="margin">

            <p>All the Officers applauded this Speech of <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> and it was concluded in the Councel, to put this reſolve in Execution with all the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition imaginable.

And then the Fleet was got within two miles of <hi>Goodſtart,</hi> and was driven ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Wind that they were forc'd to quit that project, <hi>De Ruiter</hi> by Cruizing before <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart,</hi> had alarmed all thoſe Coaſts, and conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ayſchew</hi> with all his Fleet to ſhut themſelves up in their Harbours.

            <p>The 22d. of <hi>September</hi> following, as he was ſtill cruiſing, he was aſſailed hard by <hi>Sorles,</hi> by a furious Tempeſt that laſted three days together, and on the 3d. day the Wind being appealed, he would fain have given chaſe to a Squadron of 25 of the Parliaments Ships, and that very even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he found himſelf already advanced within a mile of the Engliſh, with ſome Ships of his Fleet, but the biggeſt of them remained ſtill ſcattered to and fro. The ſame night another fierce Wind aroſe, and again diſperſed the Ships of his Fleet, ſo that he miſt his blow. For what care ſoever <hi>de Ruiter</hi> could take all the time he was cruiſing in the Channel, to get his Ships together in a Body, yet he could never effect it. One morning he found them ſo very much ſcattered, that there were ſeveral of them that were three miles diſtant one from the other; and he was ſo much in wrath at it, that he could not forbear ſignifying to his Captains, that he was unhappy to have to do with Men that heeded not his Orders. Beſides that, his Fleet began to be in want of many neceſſaries, and that which was moſt vexatious for <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> was that he ſaw himſelf in danger ſuddenly to be attackt by the whole power of <hi>England;</hi> upon which, having held a Council of War, it was there concluded, that ſince the Enemies were every where much ſtronger than they, it was to be feared, that being informed of their weakneſs, they would take their time to come and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm them; and that therefore to avoid that Misfortune, it was requiſite they ſhould with all diligence paſs the Strait of <hi>Callis,</hi> in order to go and meet Vice-Admiral <hi>de Wit,</hi>

               <hi>De Galen</hi> then went by Land to <hi>Legorn,</hi> and producing his Commiſſion to the Fleet, it ſoon appeared what he was capable of, by the attempt he made upon the Engliſh Ships coming from the <hi>Levant,</hi> whilſt on another ſide Captain <hi>Salingen</hi> kept <hi>Appleton</hi> blockt up.

All theſe reaſons were too evident to be rejected; and therefore they tackt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

            <p>It was impoſſible for <hi>de Wit,</hi> to oppoſe that Reſolution, and ſo much the more becauſe he plainly perceived, that many of his Captains were reſolved to lie ſtill, and be bare ſpectatours of a Fight to which they were no ways conſenting, and that of all the whole Fleet there were but 15 Ships that he could truſt upon, ſo ſuſpicious to him was the fidelity of all the reſt, ſo that there was no other way leſt for him to take, but to make as faſt as he could from the Enemy, which at laſt, tho' much againſt his ſtomach, that Bully-Admiral was fain to reſolve upon; yet terribly fretted he was, to ſee himſelf ſo deſerted at a time when his fooliſh Ambition flattered him, that he might have gained immortal Glory to himſelf and a great Triumph for his Country.

            </p>
            <p>The ſhamefull Cowardice of the Captains that had fled in ſuch a Rencounter as that, was ſo much the more Criminal, becauſe there was not ſo much as one ſhip loſt in the Fight out of the whole Fleet. For one Ship that had all her ſails and rigging ſhot away, yet got away in that ſad condition, into the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and all the reſt that had been battered, made a ſhift likewiſe to ſave themſelves. It will not be impertinent to inſert by the way the relation of a very Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable action. <hi>Broer Jaap,</hi> Captain of the Ship we told you, was ſo miſerably maul'd, being Grappled with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frigat, had his Mizen-Maſt and Bolt-ſprit, and part of his Ships Head ſhot away; upon which, ſeeing himſelf in ſuch a miſerable and helpleſs condition, he leapt into a Boat and relinquiſh'h his Ship to the diſcretion of the Enemy. But a Gunner<note place="margin">A remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Gunner.</note> of the ſame Ship took up a lighted match and went down into the Powder room, crying out? <hi>my Comerades, is it poſſible, you should yield! Let us rather put fire to the Powder, and ſo we shall all be ſet at liberty;</hi> Which bold and deſperate Reſolution ſo frighted the <hi>English</hi> that had Boarded her, that they ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately quitted the Ship, and left the Mr. quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Conduct her into the <hi>Meuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The States General, to remedy all theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, took a Reſolution, after they had well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themſelves of the particulars of all that had paſſed, to puniſh thoſe that had ſhewn any ſymptoms of Cowardice, and accordingly they had began to make an exact inquiry into the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of thoſe Officers, but ſoon let it fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on one ſide the Number of the Criminals was too great, and on the other the favour of powerfull interceeding friends prevail'd over the ſeverity of Juſtice.</p>

            <p>Tho' the <hi>English</hi> had had ſome diſadvantage in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> yet were they not for that a whit the leſs venturous to endeavour to retakethe <hi>Phoenix</hi> which they had loſt, and which young <hi>Tromp</hi> then was in, becauſe his own Ship called, the <hi>Maiden</hi> of <hi>Enkuiſen</hi> was ſo battered in the Battle of <hi>Elbaa</hi> and <hi>Monte Chriſto,</hi> that ſhe was hardly able to keep the Sea. And they effected that enterprize with ſo much the more eaſe, becauſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> having taken ſome freſh Codd, were gotten into a debauch, and thought themſelves ſecure enough in <hi>Legorn</hi> Road, to diſpenſe with keeping of a good Guard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bodley</hi> and Captain <hi>Cox</hi> being informed of their Frolickſome ſecurity mann'd out three Boats with 30 armed Seamen each, who were furniſh'd with bags of Meal to throw in the <hi>Dutch</hi> mens Eyes.<note place="margin">A bold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſh.</note> Being thus provided, they ſet out in the evening, and tho' the Darkneſs for a while made them loſe one anothers Company, yet they got together again at break of day, and clapt the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat a board, dividing themſelves into three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: The firſt of which had Orders to cut the Cables, the ſecond to Govern the Sails, and the third, to ſhut down the Seamen under Deck, and to kill all they met in their way.

            <p>There were 8 Seamen kill'd in this Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thoſe that were wounded were ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore at <hi>Naples.</hi> Notwithſtanding this, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> were ſtill much weaker than the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Mediterranean, For beſides the 14 Men of War Commanded by <hi>de Galen,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul at <hi>Legorn</hi> had hired 11 more, tho' 'tis true, that <hi>de Galen</hi>'s Squadron were much endamaged by the late Fight, and the others could not quickly be got ready for want of Seamen.</p>
            <p>After the unfortunate expedition of Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>de Wit,</hi> the States began to caſt their Eyes again upon Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Martin Tromp</hi> who was as much beloved of the Seamen for his mild Temper; as <hi>de Wit</hi> was hated by them, for his Cruelty; beſides that there was no body that would offer to go about to parallel the merit of the former with the great Capacity of the other. 'Tis true, ſome ſeemed not very well ſatisfied with the laſt excurſion <hi>Tromp</hi> had made, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Major part were of opinion, that as things were, they could not be without him.</p>
            <p>Thereforeat the beginnig of <hi>Novemb.</hi> the States took a Reſolution,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Fleet given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Martin Tromp.</hi>

            <p>This Fleet was compoſed of about 73 Men of War, beſides Fire Ships and other ſmaller veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Tenders.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29562:48"/> Commanded by <hi>Batten,</hi> followed him very cloſe, upon which, we fell foul upon with ſo much impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity, that our Bolt-ſprit and the point of our Ships head were broken with the ſhock. At the ſame Moment, another <hi>English</hi> Captain, named <hi>Achſon</hi> who Commanded the Ship <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> carrying 30 Guns, having likewiſe attackt us on the other ſide, we fought for an hour between them both, till at laſt the <hi>Roſe</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 60 Men kill'd, and a great many wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and two Captains kill'd, was forced to yield her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Our Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> having attackt the <hi>Bonaventure</hi> on her other ſide, we were four Grapled together, and the <hi>Bonaventure</hi> likewiſe yielded. We took poſſeſſion of the <hi>Roſe</hi> and <hi>Crown,</hi> after having taken above a 100 men out of her, and put in 60 of our own men inſtead of them. We had in our Admiral's Ship 3 men killed, and 21 wounded. Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> took likewiſe poſſeſſion of the <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> and the Night having put an end to the Fight, we caſt Anchor, and gave order to our Maſter that kept our prizes, to do the ſame. About 9 a Clock we ſtill heard the noiſe of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Rears. About the Dusk of night, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Juinbol</hi>'s Ship fell on fire, by what acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent we know not, and periſh'd with a great part of her men, but the reſt were ſaved. We ſpent all the night in repairing our Ships and our damages.</p>
               <p>On the 11th. of the aforeſaid Month, in the Morning the Wind being Weſt-North-Weſt, we perceived 2 Ships to the Weſtward, to which we gave chace. Captain <hi>Van Sanen,</hi> took one of them, which proved an <hi>English</hi> Ship of 14 Guns, laden with Figs coming from <hi>Condat.</hi> We called all our Captains on Board us, and their men in the mean while, helpt to repair our Ship, and all the other Ships in the Fleet that had need
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29562:48"/> of it. We had but very few men kill'd and wounded. Some of our Ships are ſcattered from us, and we know not which way they have ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And about one a Clock, we were got in a readineſs to weigh Anchor, with a deſign to go and ſeek out the <hi>English,</hi> either at <hi>Dover,</hi> or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Downs.</hi> We accordingly advanced for ſome time, and then the Night coming on, we were forced to come to an Anchor, <hi>Dover</hi> bearing North-Eaſt from us. On the 12th. at 10 a Clock; Captain <hi>Sentſon</hi> brought in to us one of the Parliament Ships, called the <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> carrying 26 Guns, which had on board her 80 Vagabonds that had ſaved themſelves upon that Coaſt, ſhe was bound from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> for <hi>London,</hi> in order to joyn the other Men of War that were there, deſigned to be ſent into the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> At the ſame time ſome of our ſtrayed Ships found the way back to us again. We uſed all poſſible induſtry clapping on all the ſail we could, to make towards the <hi>Downs,</hi> but found it impracticable to do it. The 13th. in the Morning, the Wind being at North North-Eaſt, we weighed Anchor, and ſtood towards the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> and came to an Anchor in the Rode of <hi>Bullen,</hi> where we received the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches of your High and Mightineſſes, dated the 7th. of this Month. As ſoon as we ſhall get all our Fleet together again, if the Wind and opportunity permit, we will go and make another attack upon the <hi>English,</hi> according to our Orders. We have gotten an account from our Priſoners, of the preſent condition their Men of War are now in, which we have ſet down in the Memorial hereto annexed, but we know not whether their report may be relied on. We im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently expect our Merchant Fleet, as alſo the Men of War and Fire Ships which lagg'd behind us when we came away; and for that effect, we have ſent out our beſt ſailors a cruiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29562:50"/> ſhort in ſunder; in one place, the Enemy was board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Ships, and in a moment after, were cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced off again, where they were ſeen to be blown up into the Air with the Deck they ſtood upon; And on another ſide, was ſeen a Ship ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the Waves with ſeveral hundreds of Men, and the Sea turned red with humane blood, and covered over with dead bodies, and float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pieces of ſhattered Ships, which yet inſtead of diſmaying the Combatants, ſerved only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame their Courage the more, and fleſh them on the more cruelly to mutual and implacable ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And the Complaints and Lamentations of the miſerable wounded wretches, inſtead of mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying their hearts with any ſentiments of pity, and inſpiring them with abhorrence for ſuch cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, rendred them but the more bloody mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the more violently excited them to fierce and remorſeleſs Revenge. <hi>Bullen</hi> and its Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on one ſide, and <hi>Portland</hi> on the other, were terribly ſhaken with the thundring noiſe of their dead-doing Guns; and in a word, it may be ſaid, that never was there any fight ſeen more cruel and obſtinately bloody then that. <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had dreamt the night before, that a Bird came and perch't on his hand, but flew away as he was going to take her, ſo that ſeeing the <hi>English</hi> draw near the next day, he cried out, <hi>There's the Bird I dream't of;</hi> he found himſelf Engaged with a great <hi>English</hi> Ship carrying 44 Guns, and 270 men, called the <hi>Proſperity,</hi> which fired moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly at him, which put him in ſuch perplexity, that he thought the beſt way to ſhelter himſelf from her fury, would be reſolutely to board her: And accordingly his Seamen readily preſenting themſelves for the Enterpriſe, with a great deal of courage and undauntedneſs, they leapt into the Enemies Ship, but were ſo hotly received there, that they were forced to retire again; but yet <hi>de Ruiter</hi> not deſpairing for all that, to carry her,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29562:50"/> at laſt, cried out to his men, <hi>My Boys? That touch was worth nothing, I pray you, my Lads, once more Courage.</hi> Upon which, giving another aſſault, they won the Ship, but <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> being afterwards over powered by the Enemies Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and deſerted by the reſt of his Squadron, was much againſt his will, conſtrained to let that be tamely taken again from him that had coſt him ſo dear.</p>
            <p>He found himſelf once encompaſt with above 20 ſail of the Enemies, but at length Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Evertſz</hi> coming in to his relief, he by his undauntedneſs, forced his paſſage through that great Number; after which, being ſeconded by the Captains, <hi>Kruik</hi> and <hi>Swers,</hi> he fought a long time againſt 7 Great <hi>English</hi> Men of War, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom was Vice-Admiral <hi>Pen,</hi> who was fain to retire very much battered to the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> there was another like wiſe diſabled, all his Maſts and rigging being ſhot away cloſe by the board; there came up beſides 4 or 5 <hi>English</hi> Ships more, and attackt afreſh <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> and his aſſiſtants, <hi>Kruik</hi> and <hi>Swers,</hi> who for all that, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves till evening, without receiving any other ſuccour than that which their own great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was able to furniſh them.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> pierced through and through the <hi>English</hi> Fleet which took up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a mile in extent, thundring at all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his paſſage.

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:29562:51"/> And gave order at the ſame time to <hi>de Wilde</hi> to go and reſcue him.

The <hi>English</hi> had already boarded her to pillage her, but being afraid, ſhe would ſink under them, they quitted her, till the ſame Enemies finding her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain next day without any ſoul in her, they carried her to <hi>Portſmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Port</hi> having attackt a great <hi>English</hi> Man of War, ſunk him, but two more falling in upon him a moment after, he received ſeveral ſhot between Wind and Water, which obliged him to call <hi>Swers</hi> to his aſſiſtance, who preſently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the head of <hi>Ports</hi> Ship at the inſtant when the two <hi>Englishmen</hi> were battering both his ſides. And ſo the 4 Ships being Grapled to one another, <hi>de Port</hi>'s Ship was overturned and ſunk together with an <hi>Englishman,</hi> but moſt of the Men were ſaved by <hi>Swers.</hi> At the ſame time <hi>Port</hi> was cruelly wounded in the Reins by a ſplinter, and was ſeen tho' thrown down on his back on the Deck to Wave his hanger in his hand to the laſt and to encourage his men, till the Waves ſwallowed up both him and his Ship. <hi>Swers</hi> likewiſe on his part had ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely handled an <hi>English</hi> ſhip that had attackt <hi>Port</hi> that he was alſo ſunk, but almoſt at the ſame time his Ship was attackt by 4 other <hi>English,</hi> and ſunk. He and ſome of his Men were ſaved by the Enemies, and carried to <hi>London</hi> after the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29562:51"/> fight; but underſtanding perfectly well the <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongue, he made himſelf paſs for a natural <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> ſo that ſhuffling himſelf in amongſt the Domeſtick ſervants of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambaſſador, he found means to get a paſſage into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and from thence into his true Country. This was the ſame <hi>Swers</hi> that was afterwards made Vice-Admiral of <hi>Holland,</hi> of the College of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and who gave many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal marks of his Courage and Ability. Captain <hi>Kleidyk</hi> of the <hi>Brill,</hi> received almoſt at one and the ſame time, the fire of 3 Great <hi>English</hi> Men of War, and being already reduced into a very pitiful condition, <hi>Regemorter</hi> a <hi>Zealand</hi> Captain came in to his Aid, and cleared one of his ſides, then <hi>Kleidyk</hi> began to take a little breath, and ſunk one of the <hi>English</hi> Ships that lay againſt the other ſide of him but ſoon after, his own Ship underwent the ſame fate, yet he ſaved himſelf and his men after a moſt wonderfull manner, for throwing themſelves into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship that lay againſt the ſide of <hi>Regemorter,</hi> they leapt at the ſame moment from thence on board <hi>Regemorter</hi> who was juſt then kill'd with 30 or 40 of his men. <hi>Kleidyk</hi> then being got thither, took the Command of the Ship, and ſpoke with ſo much courage to his people, that they begun to fire afreſh at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, and that, with ſo much ſucceſs, that it was diſabled and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter buried in the Deep. Captain <hi>Munick</hi>'s Ship, of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was taken about the ſame time, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening they burnt her.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Aart Van Nes,</hi> following cloſe after <hi>Tromp,</hi> found himſelf in the midſt of the Enemies, where he gave ſignal proofs of his undaunted Courage. He would have Grapled an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship that had the diſadvantage of the Wind, but ſhe letting flie at him a broad ſide, made him glad to ſheer off; after which, he attackt another which he furiouſly battered. He fought likewiſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29562:52"/> for ſome time, againſt the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals of the Blew and White Flaggs; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when he ſaw <hi>de Ruiter</hi> ſurrounded by 4 or 5 <hi>English</hi> Men of War, he flew in like lightning to his aſſiſtance, with Captain <hi>Balk,</hi> in which place they fought on both ſides with an unconceiveable obſtinacy, till at laſt the <hi>English</hi> letting go their hold, and tackt to the Weſt, and then <hi>Van Nes</hi> turned his to the Eaſt becauſe all his Cartridges being diſcharged, he wanted Reſpite to charge new ones, beſides that his Fore-Maſt was ſo ſhattered, that there was no piecing it up again. Rear Admiral <hi>Floriſz</hi> was for a good while, incloſed by 6 <hi>English</hi> Ships, and fought valiantly, till <hi>Tromp</hi> came and reſcued him. <hi>De Wilde,</hi> and the other Captains <hi>Vander Zaen Kemper, &amp;c.</hi> Signalized themſelves. Likewiſe Captain <hi>Scholte Wiglemo</hi> after a long fight, was blown up into the Air with all his Men. Some ſay, that being Grapled by two <hi>English</hi> Ships, and ſeeing no hopes of ſaving himſelf, he had the Courage with his own hands, to ſet fire to his Powder, that he might deſtroy the Enemies at the ſame time he was going to periſh himſelf. There were likewiſe ſome other Ships on both ſides that were ſunk. About 4 a Clock in the afternoon, <hi>Tromp</hi> was much ſurpriſed to ſee 26 of his Captains deſert the Admiral's Flag, and to retire out of the fight, whilſt on the other ſide, ſeveral of the beſt <hi>English</hi> Frigats were detach't, to go and fall upon the Merchant Ships which were under the protection of his Squadron. It was preſumed, the <hi>English</hi> intended to unmaſt them, that being not able to follow the main body of the Fleet, they might with the more eaſe make themſelves Mrs. of them; but <hi>Tromp</hi> took care to prevent the Enemies deſign, by ſpeeding to their aſſiſtance, and chacing from them the <hi>English</hi> Frigats. This firſt days fight ended not till night. It was found, that <hi>Tromp</hi> had made
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29562:52"/> that day 800 Cannon ſhot from his Ship alone, and that one ſingle Braſs Gun that was towards the poop, had been diſcharged 70 times.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet wandred about here and there during the obſcurity of the night, every veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel endeavouring to repair each one their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective damages, and to recover themſelves into a condition to maintain a ſecond fight. The next day being the 1ſt. of <hi>March,</hi> Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> put up a White Flag, and called together on board him the principal Officers of his Fleet, and exhorted them to acquit themſelves worthily of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they ow'd to their Country, and to fight like men of Honour and Courage. The <hi>English</hi> followed them cloſe at the heels and the Battle begun again next day at 10 a Clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about 3 miles to the North Weſtward of the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> had the Wind, but coming near them, we could not find they had any inclination to come to a cloſe fight, they contenting themſelves only with ſhooting at our Maſts, Sails, and Rigging, as they had done the day before. <hi>Tromp</hi> had drawn up his Fleet into the form of a <hi>Creſcent,</hi> to be the better able to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Merchant Ships; and the <hi>English</hi> came up ſix ſeveral times, to endeavour to cutoff thoſe Ships from the main body of the Fleet, but were always repulſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tromp</hi> was raviſh'd with Joy, to ſee ſome of his Captains fight more couragiouſly that day then they had done the day before. Captain <hi>Van Nes</hi> kept ſo cloſe to <hi>Tromp,</hi> that he could eaſily call him to his aſſiſtance in caſe of need. <hi>De Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29562:53"/> or backward upon which, <hi>Tromp</hi> Commanded Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Almoſt at the ſame time, the Admiral was informed, that the Merchant Ships were ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the South-Eaſt-Ward, upon which, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Van Nes</hi> was detatcht away, to Command them by <hi>Tromps</hi> order, to ſtand to the Eaſt-North Eaſt-ward in order to make towards the Strait of <hi>Callis. Van Nes</hi> performed his Commiſſion, and bid them at the ſame time clap on more Sail; but hapning to come too late, and they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neglected to execute the orders given them, the <hi>English</hi> took their opportunity to Snap ſome part of that Fleet together with two Men of War of which they made themſelves Mrs. of which one that was Commanded by <hi>Le Sage,</hi> yielded not till after a very ſtout Reſiſtance. Of the Merchant Ships, there were 12 taken, others were defended by the Men of War, and part of them ſaved themſelves in <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> as did likewiſe two Men of War that had loſt their Maſts. At the coming on of the night, an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Ship took fire, and then the fight end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, ſome Captains ſent word to <hi>Tromp,</hi> that they wanted Powder, and were not in a condition to make any longer reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, upon which, <hi>Tromp</hi> ordered them to keep by the Merchant Ships, and to make as fair a ſhew as they could with their preſence, to make the Enemy believe, they were there to defend them; and then all things were diſpoſed to be in a readineſs for a third fight. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at break of day, the <hi>English</hi> were ſeen to come on again to charge them. Upon which, <hi>Tromp</hi> having put all things in order for that purpoſe advanced towards the Enemies Fleet, with more Courage and Reſolution than any Forces he had to fight them. For at moſt he had but one poor Squadron under his Flag that had
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29562:53"/> any Ammunition left, whilſt the Reſt were unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of all things. At 10 of the Clock in the morning, the two Fleets came up with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and commenced a third Battle, which was very obſtinate and Bloody, yet without any great advantage to the Enemies. The Engliſh Vice-Admiral of the <hi>Blew</hi> Braved for ſome time the Dutch Admiral, thundring continually at him with his Guns, but he forbearing to fire till he came up almoſt cloſe to his ſide, gave him then firſt one Broad-ſide, and after that another, ſo much to the purpoſe, that he was forc'd to retire. But whilſt on one ſide, the Valiant <hi>Tromp</hi> ſignalized himſelf, many of his Captains baſely deſerted him on the other, and betook themſelves to a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful flight, beſides ſeveral others that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to it by pure neceſſity, for want of Powder. Towards the Evening, the Engliſh took ſome more of our Merchant Ships. Captain <hi>Van Neſs,</hi> at the beginning of the fight, advertiſed them by order from the Admiral, to clap on all the Sail they could, and make towards the ſtrait of <hi>Callis;</hi> but thoſe orders were neglected; <hi>Tromp</hi> ſent to them, the <hi>Fiſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Van Neſs</hi> did all he was able, to defend them,<note place="margin">More <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant Ships ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> but they falling into confuſion and diſorder, one part of them blindly threw themſelves among the Enemies Men of War, whilſt the others fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling foul upon one another, knockt themſelves to pieces. And for the Dutch Men of War that were there, they alas, could give them no aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for want of Powder, ſo that a conſiderable part of thoſe Merchant Men fell into the hands of the Engliſh.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:29562:54"/>
            <p>At the approach of the night, <hi>Blake</hi> made a ſhew as if he would have come on again to charge the Dutch Fleet, but Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> keeping himſelf in a poſture ready to ſtand the ſhock, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Admiral retired, ſteering his Courſe towards the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> whilſt the States Fleet made ſail quietly without being purſued, towards the Coaſts of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and came to an Anchor on the 3d of <hi>March,</hi> within three Miles to the Northweſtward of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> from whence they got into the Harbours of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand.</hi> Theſe three ſucceſſive Battles as the Dutch would needs flatter themſelves, coſt very nigh as dear to the Engliſh as the Dutch.

I cannot yet give your High and Mightineſſes all the particulars, becauſe most of the Captains hardly had time the 1ſt. of <hi>March,</hi> to come on board the Admiral.</p>
                  <p>They have informed me, that <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron which fell upon the Enemies Rear, took ſome Ships from them, whilſt ſeveral others on both ſides, were ſunk. As for our Van guard of which I had the joynt Conduct with Rear Admiral <hi>Floriſz,</hi> we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt that of the Enemies under the Command of <hi>Blake.</hi> The fight was fierce and obſtinate, and the Victory very wavering, ſo that neither of the Parties had any cauſe to brag of any advantage they had. This was the ſucceſs of the firſt days fight. About <hi>4</hi> a Clock in the afternoon obſerving that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had detacht a Squadron of their nimbleſt Sailors, to go and fall upon the Merchant Fleet, with deſign to burn them, we quitted the Fight, to haſten to their aſſiſtance.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:29562:57"/> go and attackt the Enemies once more, ſince we were to weak to ſpare a detachment of Men of War ſtrong enough to Convoy them; and beſides that we had ſome grounds to fear, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might have ſtill ſome body of reſerve towards <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> or whether it would not be better, to defend them, by making them keep cloſe by us, and ſo in a fighting poſture to wait the Enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſucceſs of this Battle made ſo great a noiſe at <hi>London,</hi> that they made no difficulty to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh abroad that <hi>Tromp, Evertſz,</hi> and <hi>de Ruiter</hi> were totally Routed, and that 100 Merchant Ships, and 50 Men of War of the <hi>Dutch</hi> were taken or ſunk; nay, and this noiſe was Echoed over all <hi>Europe;</hi> and was carried into <hi>France, Sweedland, Denmark,</hi> and to render what they affected to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29562:58"/> ſpeak of it, the more credible, the Parliament appointed an Extraordinary Thankſgiving day to be kept on that occaſion; and what ſeemed ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Authorize ſo great a Triumph, and exalt the glory of <hi>Blake,</hi> was, that the Priſoners were led in a Drove to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> under the Guard of a Troop of Horſe, and that in all the places through which they paſſed, they affected to ring the Bells, thereby to make that defeat to appear the more ſignal and inconteſtable; tho the <hi>Dutch</hi> at the ſame time no leſs confidently pretended, that the Action did not paſs altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo much to the advantage of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they ought to have attributed to themſelves all the Glory of it, ſince, ſay they, excepting the Merchant Ships that fell into their hands, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had not much leſs right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Victory than their Enemies.</p>

            <p>The Forces of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> conſiſted of 16 Men of War and a Fire-Ship, beſides 6 or 7 Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Ships that came from the <hi>Streights,</hi> to whom the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commanders declared, That if they would take part with them in the Battle, they ſhould ſhare with them in the Booty.

According to the project concerted between <hi>Bodley</hi> and <hi>Appleton,</hi> this latter was not to come out of <hi>Legorn,</hi> till <hi>Bodley</hi> had begun the fight. <hi>Bodley</hi> accordingly detacht out 3 of his Men of War and a Fire-Ship, to go and brave the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who ſeeing <hi>Appleton</hi> offered not to ſtir out, thought it neceſſary to uſe a Stratagem, by making as if they would go out againſt <hi>Bodley,</hi> and in effect they tackt about after him, but keeping their Eye ſtill upon the Harbour, being impatient to ſee <hi>Appleton</hi> weigh Anchor; who thinking the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would indeed have purſued their way, to make up to <hi>Bodley,</hi> ventures at length to come out with his Squadron of 6 Men of War, which the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> no ſooner perceived,<note place="margin">

But no anſwer was made to any of his Complaints.</p>
            <p>Yet his diſcontent was ſo much the better grounded, becauſe he was obliged to put to Sea, with a great Number of ſmall veſſels ill provided for War, accompanied with a great many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and unexperienc'd Officers, whereby it was to be conſidered, he muſt needs not only expoſe his life, but likewiſe that great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had gotten by ſo many brave Exploits. But time would not then permit the States to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs ſo many grievances at once. 'Tis True, that at the inſtances made by the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a Reſolution was taken to build 30 new men of War of ſufficient bigneſs to withſtand the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but that was a work required time; and in the mean while, <hi>Tromp</hi> was fain to make ſhift with thoſe ſorry ones he had already, for want of better, which at that Juncture were not to be had.</p>

            <p>'Tis true, the <hi>English</hi> had begun to carry the Terrour of their Arms to our Coaſts near the <hi>Texel</hi> and the <hi>Helder,</hi> but having landed ſome men, they were received with ſo much courage and Reſolution, as made them have little ſtomach to venture again upon ſuch another attempt. The 13th. and the 14th. of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Fleet ſaild towards the Coaſts of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and on the 15th, the two Fleets came within 5 miles one of another, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting together. Our Merchant Fleet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 300 ſail having fetcht a Compaſs about <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the greateſt happineſs in the world was already ſafe arrived into our Ports, without ſeeing any Enemies by the way. <hi>Tromp</hi> having Convoyed our Merchant Ships to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as far as <hi>Hitland,</hi> and not finding thoſe there that were to come from <hi>France,</hi> and which he had Orders to Conduct home, returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Coaſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> about the end of

            <p>On Witſunday, <hi>Tromp</hi> had a Conference with three Deputies of the States General: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of their Conſultation, was that <hi>Tromp</hi> ſhould make towards the <hi>Downs</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in hopes to meet there with ſome of the Parliaments Ships. On the 4th. of <hi>June</hi> they diſcovered ſome of them to the Northward, upon which holding a Council of War, it was reſolved that <hi>de Ruiter</hi> with his Squadron joyntly with Rear-Admiral <hi>Floriſz,</hi> ſhould ſteer to the Southward, whilſt <hi>Tromp</hi> with Vice-Admiral <hi>de Wit</hi> ſhould move to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that ſo by ſhutting up the Enemies Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons within the <hi>Downs,</hi> they might attack them with the greater effect. But the <hi>English,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Bodley,</hi> who was returned with a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of 8 men of War, and 8 Merchant Ships, from the Mediteranean, were come to an Anchor under the Caſtles of the <hi>Downs,</hi> of which <hi>Tromp</hi> had had advice; <hi>Bodley</hi> to eſcape him, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the Weſtward, ſo that Admiral <hi>Floriſz</hi> coming thither firſt, found no more but two lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ships that were retired under the Cannon of the Caſtles of <hi>Dover,</hi> and the <hi>Downs,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> begun then to Cannonade them briskly, to which they returned as vigorouſly; But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> at length getting nearer <hi>Dover,</hi> found in that road 5 ſmall veſſels, of which three were taken, tho' they had at the very firſt ſight of our Ships, cut their Cables, to eſcape, the fourth fled, and the fifth which was a Frigat retired quite under the Caſtle.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:29562:67"/>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> fired moſt terribly from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Dover</hi> upon the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> but <hi>Tromp</hi> anſwered them ſo vigorouſly, that all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Country were alarmed at it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not where to flie, and durſt not ſtay in their Houſes which they ſaw unroofed by the <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> Cannon balls.</p>
            <p>After that Expedition, <hi>Tromp</hi> advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Swartneſs,</hi> where being informed, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet had appeared near the <hi>

The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was then compoſed of 98 men of War, but all of them much ſmaller, and nothing near ſo well provided for War, as thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The Wind was North-Eaſt, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the Weather-gage. The two Fleets having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſome time in preſence of one another, without any offer made by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to attack the <hi>Hollanders, Tromp</hi> did all he could by Luf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing to get up to them; when he came nigh them, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> began at length to caſt their Fleet into a line of Battle, and divided it into three Squadrons. They at firſt made a Motion with deſign to encloſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> within a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, but when they ſaw the others obſerve them very narrowly, and ſeem reſolved to ſtand them, their Squadrons joyned again, and advanced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Cannon ſhot of their Enemy; and then <hi>Monk</hi> and <hi>Dean</hi> gave the ſignal for Battle and ſo the two Fleets engaged about 11 a Clock before noon.<note place="margin">A cruel fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Tromp</hi> and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Monk.</hi>

While they were fighting, the wind hapning quite to fall, the <hi>English</hi> White Squadron was by that means ſeparated from the reſt of their Fleet; the <hi>Hollanders</hi> willing to improve that opportunity, advanced with deſign to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, whilſt the <hi>English</hi> on the other, did all they could, to rejoin their Forces, but before they could effect it, the <hi>Dutch</hi> preſſed cloſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>English</hi> Blue Squadron, and with broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides made their way through the <hi>English</hi> Fleet.</p>
            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:29562:68"/>
            <p>The Victory having a long time Wavered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun then to declare it ſelf for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who making their Enemies give way, purſued them, but a great diſorder hapning in their Fleet, the <hi>English</hi> knew ſo well to make their advantage of it, that they gained the Weather-gage of them, which gave life to a ſecond Engagement no leſs bloody than the firſt, and which cauſed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the moſt part of the Ships that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed both the Fleets. About 9 at night ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>English</hi> Ship was burnt, but they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill fighting till the night parted them; And then the <hi>English</hi> ſtood to the Northward, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to the South-ward; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, when the Enemies were already reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of Canon ſhot, as Captain <hi>Van Velzen</hi> was firing off his laſt ſhot, his Powder took fire, and blew up his Ship with almoſt all his Men, hardly 55 eſcaping of the whole Ships Crew.</p>
            <p>The whole night was ſpent in repairing the damages received in the Battle, and mending up as well as poſſible, the Ships that were moſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. At break of day, next morning, the two Fleets found themſelves not above a mile diſtant one from the other. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> put out the uſual ſignal to call his Officers on board him, at whoſe arrival, he with much vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heard the ill news, that moſt part of the Ships of his Fleet wanted Ammunition, by which they were diſabled to ſtand a ſecond Battle. It muſt be confeſſed, that if <hi>Tromp</hi> had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded as he ought to have been the day before, by ſome Captains in his Fleet that failed in their duty, and were falſe to the fidelity they had ſworn to their Country, the <hi>English</hi> had been ſo well reduced to reaſon, that they would hardly have had any mind to begin a new Battle the next day. Vice-Admiral <hi>de Wit</hi> had ſo ſmall a Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Powder and Bullets left, that it would hardly ſerve him three hours firing: and <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had leſs
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29562:69"/> than he: And beſides, a great many other Ships were much weakened by the great Numbers of Men they had killed, and ſick. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe diſadvantages, <hi>Tromp</hi> was in the mind to venture a ſecond Battle, as thinking, if he were worſted to retreat toward <hi>Wielingen,</hi> to take in neceſſary Proviſions and Ammunition.

            <p>Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> had done all he could from the firſt appearance of the morning,<note place="margin">A ſecond Battle fought the 13th. of <hi>June.</hi>
               </note> to tack to the South-Eaſt, to be able to get the Weather gage which the Engliſh had, that ſo he might the more ſucceſsfully force his way into the middle of their Fleet. About 8 a Clock the Van-guards of the two Fleets began to fire at one another at a diſtance; but <hi>Tromp</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his deſign, had already about 10 a Clock got <hi>Dunkirk</hi> at the South-South Eaſtward of him, and was in hopes to get up to the main bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, and to intercept a good part of their Ships. But they were no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, but their hapned a Calm, which was the cauſe, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> found themſelves to the lee-ward, and the <hi>English</hi> had the Weathergage; which opportunity they improving, came Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering about 11 a Clock upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, with ſo much the greater advantage, becauſe <hi>Blake</hi> had reinforced them in the night with a Squadron of 28 great men of War which he had brought from <hi>Portſmouth. Tromp</hi> thereby found himſelf obliged to cloſe up the Rear of his Fleet, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour as well as 'twas poſſible, to ſuſtain the ſhock of the Enemies. <hi>Tromp, De Wit, De Ruiter,</hi> and ſome others fought with an unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd bravery; But unhapily from the very beginning of the fight, a diſorder having hapned in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet for want of Experience in the Officers, they began to give way, and at length were part of them taken, and part ſunk; nay, the Confuſion was ſo great among them, that ſome of them quitted their Fire-Ships after having ſet fire to them themſelves, who endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to palliate their infamous Cowardice, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, they had received ſeveral ſhot between
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29562:70"/> Wind and Water. However, tho' the valiant <hi>Tromp</hi> ſaw himſelf thus deſerted by his Rear-guard, yet he loſt not his courage for that, but poſſeſſing ſtill the ſame preſence of mind, and being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by Reflections upon his paſt glory, and by the hopes and unextinguiſhable paſſion he had, ſtill to maintain it to the laſt, grapled Vice-Admiral <hi>Pen,</hi> boarded him, and power-d ſo many men into his Enemies Ship; that he had already made himſelf Maſter of her, when 13 <hi>English</hi> Frigats tacking about upon him, ſo cruelly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, that they forced him to let go his hold.</p>
            <p>The Enemies likewiſe in their turn, grapling afterwards Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> powred in ſo great a Number of Sea men, on board him that his men were forced to flie all under Deck. Upon which, <hi>Tromp</hi> ſeeing himſelf over powr'd with Numbers, thought there was no other Remedy, but to ſet fire to ſome barrels of Powder, which he did ſo effectually, that in an Inſtant as by a clap of Thunder, the Enemies were blown up Pell Mell into the Air, and their bodies were ſeen to flie about half burnt, and rent to pieces. Yet this blow did not ſo much diſcourage the <hi>English,</hi> but they came on and charged him afreſh; and he had certainly been loſt, had not <hi>de Wit</hi> and <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> eſpying the great danger he was in, come up without loſing time and diſengaged him about 7 a Clock in the Evening.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Schellinger</hi>'s Ship being much battered, and deſerted by moſt of her Sea men, fell into the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, and was ſoon after burnt to Aſhes. The Ship <hi>Weſtergoo,</hi> being ſurrounded, by three <hi>English</hi> men of War, that furiouſly battered her on all ſides, was forced to yield juſt when ſhe was ready to ſink; a little before that, Captain <hi>Verburg</hi>'s Ship having had her Helm ſhot away, fell into the Enemies hands, and after a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſiſtance, was at laſt conſtrained alſo to

            <p>The next morning the <hi>Engliſh</hi> appear'd again; But becauſe there were many Ships in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet very much ſhattered, and that wanted both Proviſion and Ammunition, <hi>Tromp</hi> with the advice of the other General Officers, thought it beſt to retreat with the whole Fleet towards <hi>Wielingen,</hi> where being arrived he writ the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter to the States General.</p>

The Fight broke not off till towards Evening. There hapned ſome diſorder amongſt ſome Ships of the Fleet, cauſed doubtleſs by the Ignorance and want of Experience of the Sea Officers, which was the reaſon that the nimbleſt <hi>English</hi> ſailors coming up with them, eaſily intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and either took or ſunk them. So that according to the report made to us this morning on board the Admiral, we hear, that the Captains, <hi>Verburg, Schellinger, Laurenſz, Duin, Fieterſz,</hi> and <hi>Weſtergoo,</hi> are fallen into the hands of the Enemies. If there were any more taken or ſunk, it is more than I know yet, becauſe I have been able to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by the report of others, and becauſe the thick ſmoak ariſing from the Canon, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,

It is poſſible they might loſe us in the night, and may be gotten into ſome Harbour, tho' againſt Order. The Pilot <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heyden,</hi> being juſt now come hither, has delivered us the two Letters from your High and Mightineſſes, dated the 9th. of this Month. he reports, he met 17 of our Ships before <hi>Schow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> and that he ſpoke with 4 of them. Our Ships are in a moſt pitifull Condition, and want both Proviſions and Ammunition. The two Fleets are ſtill in preſence one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the <hi>English</hi> with the Reinforcement they have received are now 100 ſail ſtrong of Men of War. By the advice of all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers of the Fleet; we have reſolved to retire to <hi>Wielingen,</hi> to wait there for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of your High and Mightineſſes, to come and give Order, that the Fleet may receive the neceſſary Ammunition, and a conſiderable Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, to enable them to make head againſt their Enemies. For otherwiſe, Humanely ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if all the things I have ſpoken of, be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, nothing elſe can be expected but ſhame and confuſion to the States, and misfortune to their Arms, conſidering the mighty power of their Enemies. Our Admiral Ship, the <hi>Brede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode</hi> has received ſeveral ſhot between Wind and Water, and tho we have had her calkt as well as poſſible, yet ſhe leaks ſtill ſo much, that in the night the Water gained upon us, in ſpite of all our Pumps, above 5 foot in height, however till at preſent we have made a ſhift by the help of many hands to keep her above Water; but if after all, we find our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour loſt, we ſhall be obliged to run her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore behind Ramekens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Tromp,</hi> and the reſt of the General Officers of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet being come to <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> into the preſence of the Deputies of the States,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the States Fleet.</note> they all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly declare'd, that it was impoſſible for them, to continue their Services, unleſs the Fleet were re-inforc'd with a conſiderable number of Great Ships, well appointed and furniſht for War; And ſo much the more, becauſe there were in the Engliſh Fleet above 50 Men of War, the leaſt of which was better than that in which Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Tromp</hi> ſail'd, whereas on the contrary, there were reckon'd above 50 Ships in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet that were unfit for Service, <hi>&amp;c.

The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Beſiege the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> Three <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> ſhips, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant men taken by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</note> unleſs the Fleet were re-inforc'd, and made more numerous, and were better Arm'd than it had been before: And Vice-Admiral <hi>De wit</hi> being afterwards preſent in the Aſſembly of the States, added to all thoſe Complaints, theſe words: <hi>Why ſhould I keep any longer ſilence? I am here before my Soveraigns, and am free to ſpeak; and I can ſay, That the</hi> Engliſh <hi>are at preſent Maſters both of us, and of the Seas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The States General therefore endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy all thoſe Diſorders, and to repair all the loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they had lately ſuſtained, as well as 'twas poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, in ſo preſſing a juncture. But in the mean time, the Engliſh Fleet held the Coaſts of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as 'twere beſieged, after they had ſtopt up the mouth of the <hi>Texel:</hi> Which obliged the States to prevent any diſcent from them, to poſt ſome Troops in the Iſles, and on the Coaſts. During which Diſtreſs, 3 Ships returning from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> richly Laden, unfortunately fell into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as did likewiſe two others coming from <hi>Portugal,</hi> and 3 more from <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whereof 2 were Burnt, and the reſt taken. And towards the ſtraits of <hi>Callis,</hi> Captain <hi>Wight</hi> likewiſe, was taken with 4 Ships laden with Salt.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:29562:72"/>
            <p>About that time the United Provinces began to feel the Effects of new Troubles raiſed by a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction formed among the <hi>Mobb,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tumults in <hi>Holland</hi> upon the late bad ſucceſs.</note> which being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accuſtomed to meaſure things only by the Event, attributed the Cauſe of the Diſaſters of the State, and of the deſtruction of Commerce, to their Governours. For Trading was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Artificers and Handy-craft People knew not which way to ſubſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t any longer. The Town of <hi>Enkuiſen</hi> had a great hand in all theſe Diſorders. The Towns-men being deſperately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, to ſee the Sea ſhut up againſt them, and their Fleet that was ready to ſail out to go a Herring-fiſhing, on which in great meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the Proſperity of all the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to be thus Coopt up, and forced to lie idle in their Ports.</p>
            <p>The murmurings of the people were riſen to that height, that 'twas impoſſible to ſtop them. For they loudly complained, that none of them could tell how to get their living any longer, what Trade ſoever they took to; That if they had a mind to oppoſe the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> why did not <hi>Tromp</hi> come back from <hi>Zealand?</hi> Why were not the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies driven out of the Harbors of the <hi>Texel,</hi> who without controul, took daily from them Ship after Ship, whilſt they ſaw themſelves beſieged, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an inevitable Series of Miſchiefs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates of that Town, thinking to put a ſtop to the fatal Conſequences of all thoſe Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, would needs have Recourſe to force of Arms, and ſent for ſome Troops which in Boats approacht the Town: But the <hi>Mobb</hi> the more fiercely inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at that, got together in ſuch multitudes, that they carried all before them, and ſeized upon the Town-Houſe, the Gates, the Ramparts, and all the Stores of Warlike Amunition. Which done, they put up upon the Towers, the Princes Colours, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning by that, to revenge the ſlight the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29562:72"/> then proceeded to Depoſe the Magiſtrates, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſeveral Vollies of Shot from their Muskets, upon the Souldiery that was embarked in the Boats. The Deputies from the States, and the Sieur <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derode,</hi> who were ſent from the <hi>Hague,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe, if it were poſſible this popular Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were conſtrained to ſtay without the Town-Gate. And if the Gentleneſs and Moderation which they uſed had not at laſt prevailed over the Fury and Inſolence of thoſe raſh and headſtrong Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniers, they would have been in great danger of being overturned with their Coaches off from the Cawſey into the Sea.</p>
            <p>So Bold an example open'd a door to the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of other Factious Spirits, which was ſo much the more dangerous, becauſe the Affairs they meddled with, were both Nice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant.</p>
            <p>The War againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was not heartily undertaken, ſaid they,<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject heads of the peoples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</note> and yet the Subjects of the United Provinces were daily more and more impoveriſhed thereby. They further alledged, that the interruption of Commerce both within and without the Country, preſaged already great misfortunes to them, their Numerous Inhabitants being able to ſubſiſt no longer, being deprived as they were, of traffiking with the neighbouring States. That if they had Forces, they ought to be employed, to free the Sea from the Yoak of a Power that claim'd to it ſelf the ſole Dominion of it; That they had reaſon to fear the worſt that could be imagined from the cruel Injuſtice of their Neighbours, if after having loſt ſo much Blood, they ſhould fall to ſo low an ebb of ſtrength as to be unable to reſiſt the Enemy; That their Merchant Ships were taken in view of the <hi>Texel,</hi> and the Seamen made the Innocent victims of Cruelty; That their Ships were ſo ill Equipt, that they were not able to reſiſt the full man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and well appointed Ships of the

               <hi>Engliſh;</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1652"/> that they were no longer, able to ſupport the Violences and Hoſtilities uſed by them to the States Ships, the major part of them having been ſhattered to pieces by their Guns, their Maſts and all their Rigging being ſhot away cloſe by the Board; that to Compleat their Misfortune, if there were left any that made reſiſtance, they were baſely deſerted in their danger, by their cowardly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; that if there were any ſhadow of Juſtice yet left, the crimes of thoſe cowardly deſerters ought not to be ſuffered to go ſo long unpuniſht; and that they ought to have been brought ſooner to condign Puniſhment, that they might ſerve for ſuch effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual examples to others, as might make them more heartily and faithfully ſtick for the future, to the intereſt of their Reputation, and of their Country. After all which they repreſented, the Tranquility the Government had enjoyed under the happy and auſpicious influence of the <hi>State-Holders,</hi> who had the only ſecret harmoniouſly to accord and reconcile ſo many jarring Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and different Spirits; That a Power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſo many Heads was but a monſtrous <hi>Hydra,</hi> from whence ſprung all the diſorders that troubled the Repoſe of the State; That the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible decay that had lately happened in all their Affairs, was a manifeſt conſequence of the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Governours; That the inequality, or ſubordinate dependence of the one upon the other, kept the Power of the State in a due <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium;</hi> That none of them could pretend to be ignorant, that they were all beholding for the ſweet Liberty they then enjoyed, to the Houſe of <hi>Naſſau;</hi> That that Illuſtrious Houſe had been always the moſt firm and ſolid pillar and ſupport of their Peace and Happineſs: That they had reaſon to thank God, for that they had ſtill left ſo worthy and hopeful a Sprout of ſo Noble and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Blood: That the United Provinces never had any reaſon to Complain of the moderation of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29562:73"/> their Government: And that therefore, they could not comprehend for what reaſon the lawful heir of that <hi>Auguſt</hi> Family was not put into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Offices and Dignities which his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors had juſtly merited for him and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants, by ſo many Brave and Glorious Actions.</p>
            <p>This was the ſubſtance of the peoples diſcourſe, who were animated by the name of <hi>Orange,</hi> which they repeated, every moment, without paying any deference to the Orders of the States. And the Drummers that beat up for raiſing of Seamen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making uſe of the old accuſtomed Terms, <hi>In the name of the Prince of</hi> Orange, were ill handled by the people; ſo that at laſt the Government was obliged to publiſh an Ordinance to put a ſtop to thoſe Commotion; and at the ſame time another was likewiſe ſet out, to forbid the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of any Proviſions to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet that lay before the <hi>Texel</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did a wonderful deal of miſchief upon the Coaſts of <hi>Holland,</hi> but were partly puniſhed for it by the loſs of 3 of their Ships that run a Ground upon the Sands of the Coaſt; they had alſo ſome Boats overſet.</p>
            <p>Amidſt all theſe Tranſactions, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> wrought with all the diligence imaginable upon the Fleet, in order to Repair and Re-inforce, and Man, and Provide it ſufficiently to be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to put again to Sea. But becauſe moſt part of the Ships were equipt in <hi>Zealand,</hi> they were in extreme pain to ſtudy out a means, how thoſe that came from <hi>Zealand</hi> ſhould joyn with thoſe that were in the <hi>Texel,</hi> ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were Maſters of its enterance, and kept the Coaſts of <hi>Holland</hi> beſieged. However <hi>Tromp</hi> after ſix weeks ſtay in <hi>Zealand,</hi> put at length to Sea the 6th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> with a Fleet of between 80 and 90 Sail, with a reſolution, aſſoon as he had joyned
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29562:74"/> Vice-Admiral <hi>De Wit</hi>'s Squadron, to make up d<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rectly to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to give them Battle, and chaſe them if poſſible, from the Coaſts of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About that time the States General of the United Provinces, to encourage their Officers and Sea men of the Fleet, the more heartily and warmly to beſtir themſelves in the Service of their Country, by the hopes of Reward, publiſht a Declaration, which was Read on Board every Man of War, and was as follows.</p>

            <p>The recompence of thoſe that were only lam'd was left to the diſcretion of the Colleges of the Admiralty.

            <p>The <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet then being got to Sea, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the 7th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> towards the Evening, to the Northwards of <hi>Gravezande;</hi> on the 8th at break of day, they ſailed near to <hi>Zandwoort,</hi> and advanced about 8 a Clock the ſame morning near <hi>Egmond.</hi> Their advanc'd Guard detacht ſome of their beſt Sailers, to advertiſe <hi>Tromp,</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet were but 5 Miles from him to the North-Eaſtward, and ſoon after they begun to perceive them. About a 11 a Clock, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> got the Weather-gage, the wind being <hi>Weſt-North-Weſt.</hi>

About a 11 a Clock, the wind turn'd to the <hi>Weſt-North-Weſt,</hi> and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> had the advantage of it: upon which, we thought fit to draw back, to oblige the Enemy to draw likewiſe out from the <hi>Texel,</hi> to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thereby the coming out of the reſt of the Fleet under the conduct of Vice-Admiral <hi>De Wit.</hi>

            <p>The day following, the Wind was ſo high that it was impoſſible to renew the Battle; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely favoured the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> For by that means Vice-Admiral <hi>De Wit</hi> had time to come out of the <hi>Texel,</hi> being haſtned by the Deputies of the States, who upon advice of the two Fleets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come in preſence of one another before <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> made him uſe all the diligence imaginable.

            <p>On the 9th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at 6 a Clock in the morning, <hi>Tromp</hi> being right againſt <hi>Scheveling,</hi> approached the Enemies, being backt by ſome men of War of the Van guard, and fired at them ſome broad ſides, but finding himſelf too weak, he retired towards <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Squadron, and ſtood to the North North-Eaſt. And the Wind
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29562:76"/> being again grown fiercer, it was impoſſible for the two Fleets to engage, upon which, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet approach'd again to the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> The Wind turning afterwards to the North Weſt, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the Weather-gage, and purſued the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About noon, <hi>de Wit</hi> begun to appear with a Reinforcement of 27 Men of War, and 4 Fire-Ships. The two Fleets joyned about 5 in the afternoon, in ſight of the Enemies Fleet, they not being able to hinder them. <hi>Tromp</hi> being then 106 ſail ſtrong, advanced directly towards the Enemies, who at firſt ſeemed to flie, only out of deſign, as afterwards it proved, to get more convenient Sea room; <hi>Tromp</hi> purſued them all night with a Wind North-Weſt, and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Weſt, and the day following being the 10th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the two Fleets met again before the <hi>Meuſe</hi> over againſt <hi>Heide</hi> and <hi>Scheveling.</hi>

And ſo the Fleet being divided into 5 Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, fell as ſoon as it was Morning, upon the <hi>English.</hi> There never was any thing ſeen ſo cruel and ſo bloody as the beginning of that fight. One would have ſaid at firſt view, that the Sun being covered with a thick ſmoak, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to hide his face, that he might not be the ſpectator of ſo horrible a ſlaughter. The noiſe of the Canon much louder than that of Thunder made all the neighbouring ſhores to tremble, and flying from thence to ſpend it ſelf in the <hi>Downs,</hi> was redoubled thence by Echo's, and became much more frightfull. And the Sea being tinged all over with the blood of ſo many Butcheries, ſwallowed up with equal greedineſs both Men and Ships.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:29562:76"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Tromp</hi> had already the firſt time pierced into the <hi>English</hi> Fleet with ſo much ſucceſs, that he had ſome reaſon to flatter himſelf with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of a Victory; and coming on a ſecond time, and falling upon the biggeſt of the <hi>English</hi> men of War, there the undaunted Courage of that Great Admiral, and the bravery of his Seamen, were ſeen to ſhine forth in their full Glory: For ſometimes he went into the Captains Chamber, and taking up a Teleſcope, he took a view of all the Squadrons of his Fleet, and obſerved whether every one did his duty or no, and thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again upon Deck, he went and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his men, and uſed all the Rhetorick he could to inſpire them with love for their Country. However, after all, being engaged a great way within the very heart of the Enemies Fleet, he found himſelf overpower'd by their Numbers, and deſerted by his own Ships, at which, conceiving a mortal reſentment, he uttered theſe words: <hi>VVill any thing be done or no? I muſt it ſeems perish! No body comes in to my aſſiſtance; Muſt I alone this day, be the Victime of the Enemies?</hi> His Ship being covered with a thick Cloud of ſmoke was not to be ſeen any longer, and in the mean while the <hi>English</hi> Rear-Admiral followed by ſome Frigats, approaching to him, there flew from the third of that Rank,<note place="margin">Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Tromp</hi> kill'd in the Battle.</note> a fatal ball that ſtruck him on the left Temple, as he was giving order about his Guns, and laid him for dead at the feet of his Lamenting Seamen.</p>
            <p>So mournfull an accident pierced them to the Quick, that to revenge the death of ſo valiant a man, and that it might not be ſaid, the Author of ſo terrible an Action went unpuniſht, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoldier of the Admiral Ship, advancing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Deck, ſhot the Captain of the aforeſaid Frigat in the cheek, and fell'd him dead with a musket Bullet, as he was making Bravado's with his drawn hanger in his hand. Lieutenant
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29562:77"/> Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> being carried immediately into the Captains Chamber, was laid upon a Pillow, and ſome moments after, gave up the Ghoſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had exhorted his Seamen, to fight like men of Courage and prayed God to take into his protection all that were under his Command. Some report,<note place="margin">He dies.</note> that at the approach of death, he addreſſed theſe words to his men? <hi>I have finiſht my Courſe, have good Courage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Ship, <hi>Brederode</hi> was engaged within the main Body of the Enemies Fleet; and becauſe every one attentively lookt out to ſee whether the Bloody Flagg which was the ſignal for coming on board, appeared upon the Admirals Poop, the Chief Officers of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, found by that, they were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on board the Admiral. Where being come, and being informed of their great loſs, upon a conſultation held thereupon, they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that to prevent the Seamens being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, the death of the valiant <hi>Tromp</hi> ſhould be concealed; and recommended to the Captain on board the Admirals Ship, that he ſhould keep to the Orders <hi>Tromp</hi> had before given, and keep up ſame Flag. After which they all haſtned back e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to his reſpective Ship, and continued the fight.</p>
            <p>Upon this fatal blow, it appear'd what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and undaunted reſolution are able to make men do: For all the Captains of the Fleet were ſo ſenſibly toucht at the loſs of their Admiral, that breathing nothing but rage and fury, they pierced three times through and through the Enemies Fleet, fiercely firing at and battering all that oppoſed their paſſage; but as an addition to the unhappineſs of that unfortunate day, Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi>'s Ship, who after <hi>Tromp</hi>'s death had the chief Command of the Fleet, was ſo miſerably ſhattered and diſabled, that to avoid falling into the hands of the <hi>English,</hi> they were
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29562:77"/> forced to carry her off into the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> having on board her 70 men killed or wounded. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> who was in the Ship called the <hi>Lamb,</hi> carrying about 40 Guns and 150 men, was expoſed to the greateſt fire of the Enemies, fighting with ſo much Courage, that he made his way through the midſt of the <hi>English</hi> Squadron; but he found himſelf at length ſo extreamly weakned, that he had hardly half his men left, 43 of them being killed, and 35 wounded: His mizzen maſt, his main yard, and in General, all his rigging except of his Poop was ſhot away, and of Ammunition he had but 700 pound of Powder and very few Bullets left, ſo that ſeeing himſelf reduced into ſo pitifull a Condition that he was no longer able to keep the Sea, he was at laſt forced to be towed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into the <hi>Meuſe</hi> by Captain <hi>Aldertſz de Hoorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Admiral being grappled by two Fire-Ships, his Ship was in an inſtant all in a flame, and ſome of his men began already to flie out of her; they which were about Captain <hi>Peacock</hi> were at the laſt extremity; and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Bitter</hi> was compleating their deſtruction by plying them with frequent broad-ſides, but that one of the Fire-Ships hapning to be too ſlowly puſht forward, gave time and occaſion to the <hi>English</hi> to take new Courage, and briskly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their Guns again, and beat off their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The <hi>English</hi> Ship, the St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> having been furiouſly battered by the Guns of Vice-Admiral <hi>Floriſz,</hi> was ſo terribly maul'd and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that it was ready to ſink, being half con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with the flames, had not two other Ships come in timely to her aid, and reſcued her from the Eminent danger ſhe was in. Captain <hi>Grave</hi> periſht by fire with a great many of his Seamen. As for Captain <hi>Haas</hi> who Commanded the Ship called, the <hi>Roſe</hi> and <hi>Crown,</hi> being attackt by 3 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War, he defended himſelf vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29562:78"/> till ſuch time as his Maſts and all his rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging being ſhot away cloſe by the board, his veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel half burnt, and many of his men kill'd, he thought fit to retreat, and as much ſhattered and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as he was, made his way through the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and got likewiſe to <hi>Goree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hoyen Cox,</hi> whom we have ſeveral times men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned upon occaſion of the Ship <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and Captain <hi>Zanger,</hi> fought againſt one another with ſo much courage and obſtinacy, that both their Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Phoenix</hi> and the <hi>Weſt Kappel</hi> were ſunk. <hi>Schatter</hi> finding himſelf engaged with the Van guard of <hi>Monk</hi>'s Squadron, made head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them alone, and if his Ship, the <hi>Golden Dolphin</hi> had not at laſt been ſunk, being pierced through and through as ſhe was with Bullets, he would doubtleſs have made the Enemies pay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dearer for her loſs: But however fortune being willing in ſome ſort to recompence deſert, had compaſſion of ſo many brave men, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Frigat to paſs by his ſide, as he was juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be ſwallowed up by the Waves, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to ſave him and all his men. But Captain <hi>Vanger</hi> was more unfortunate then thoſe Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, his Ship and all his men ſinking in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant into the deep.</p>
            <p>We ought likewiſe to allow an honourable place in the liſt of thoſe that ſignaliz'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this fight, to <hi>de Wilde,</hi> and to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>Marreveld, Swart,</hi> and <hi>de Kampen.</hi> About 2 a Clock in the afternoon, both the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties begun to make out into the wide Sea. The <hi>Dutch</hi> had broken four times quite through the Enemies Fleet, ſo that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be ſeen almoſt but maſts tumbled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, and ſeveral Ships on fire both of the one and other ſide, amongſt which there was one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship that was blown up, and ſome others that were ſunk. <hi>Schevelin, Heide, Kat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wik, Nordwyk, Zandvort,</hi> and all the whole
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29562:78"/> Coaſt were Witneſſes of this bloody fight, and of the bravery of two ſuch formidable Nations. By favour of a Weſtern Wind, the two Fleets approacht the Coaſts of <hi>Holland,</hi> however the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were obſerved to uſe all their endeavours to retire, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> thereupon were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to believe, they had ſome diſadvantage; ſo that finding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtood to the Northward, they reſumed the courage to purſue them, after they had received a recruit of 30000 pound of Powder and other Ammunition proportionable, which was brought them by ſome Fiſhing veſſels. The Wind riſing higher, the two Fleets by favour of the Tide, approach'd towards <hi>Gorce,</hi> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firing at one another till 11 a Clock at night. At laſt the Wind chopping about to the South-Weſt, drove them inſenſibly towards the <hi>Texel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> routed.</note> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> having made a tack to the Weſtward, ſet ſail, whilſt 20 <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains detaching themſelves from the body of their Fleet, ſhamefully deſerted the line of Battle, and ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away for the <hi>Texel.</hi> The Moon then ſhone ſo bright, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> perceived it; which made them conceive new hopes, and encouraged them to give the <hi>Dutch</hi> another on ſet, upon which, Fifty more of the Ships of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet that had ſuffered moſt, fled away to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whilſt a good part of the reſt threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves croſs the Sand-banks! crying out? all was loſt</p>
            <p>After ſo fatal a rout, 30 other Ships that were leaſt endamaged, came out of the Rear guard and advanced againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And Rear Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Floriſz</hi> endeavoured with thoſe feeble and ſhattered relicks of ſo potent a Fleet, to cover the Admiral Ship the <hi>Brederode,</hi> which was in ſo much the more danger of falling into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, bccauſe ſhe was ſo cruelly ſhattered, that ſhe was incapable of making any Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Yet her preſervation was ſo much the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29562:79"/> dearer, and the more important for that the loſs of the Battle depended thereon. The laſt new Encounter of this horrible Fight, laſted three full hours. Vice-Admiral <hi>de Wit</hi> let flie ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral broad ſides at the Cowardly deſerters to ſtop them, if poſſible, but ſeeing all in vain, he rallied together into one body the reſt of the Ships of the Fleet, by leaving the Main-ſails but half diſplayed.</p>
            <p>That unexpected firmneſs and reſolution ſo much ſurprized the <hi>English,</hi> that being advanced as far as right againſt the Lordſhip of <hi>Brederode,</hi> they put up all the ſail they could, and ſteered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way towards the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> quitting thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> with much regret, and ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Wills, as thinking they had won Glory enough, and that it would be too much to expoſe both it and their Fleet, in the ſhattered condition they were in, to proſecute their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory too far, and that after they had been at home and recruited, they might inſult as they pleaſed over their vanquiſht foes, before they could recover themſelves of this laſt fatal blow. In their retreat, they ſet fire to ſome of their Ships that were ſo ſhattered and maul'd, that they were not able to get them back into their Ports. By favour of the night, the flames were ſeen from far, and the Sea was enlighted with them almoſt as much as if it had been by the Sun-beams at Noon day. The next morning, Vice-Admiral <hi>de VVit,</hi> found himſelf before <hi>Wyk,</hi> diſengaged from all his Enemies, and ſailed away with the reſt of the Fleet towards the <hi>Texel.</hi> The loſs of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in this Battle,<note place="margin">The loſs on the Dutchſide.</note> according to their own account, amounted to no more than 9 men of War burnt or ſunk, moſt of whoſe men were ſaved by the <hi>English,</hi> becauſe they ſunk amongſt their Squadrons, ſo that by that means, they made above 700 Priſoners. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Ship, <hi>Brederode</hi> and 3 other Ships were
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29562:79"/> extremely ſhattered. There were 50 that had endured the hotteſt of the Enemies fire, and 30 others that were not ſo much expoſed. The Number of their dead were reported to be but 500, tho' 'tis more probable 'twas 5000, and that of their wounded, 700 men.</p>

Amongſt their dead, whoſe Number was ſaid to amount, to 600, were Reckon'd, Rear-Admiral <hi>Graves,</hi> the Captains <hi>Peacock, Edmond, Chapman, John Tailour, VVilliam Newman, Hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Cox,</hi> and <hi>Crips.</hi> The Number of their woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was ſaid to be little leſs than 2500, amongſt whom were reckoned Vice Admiral <hi>Lawſon,</hi> the Captains <hi>William Reus, Holland, Joſeph Cubit, John Stokes,</hi> and ſome others.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29562:80"/> War kept the miſerable ſhattered Relicks of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet beſieged before the <hi>Texel,</hi> and that 30 more freſh Ships were ſailed out, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce them, and to aſſiſt them to Compleat their deſtruction. And to render this repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Victory ſo much the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, they affected to publiſh a liſt of about 50 <hi>Dutch</hi> men of War taken, burnt, or ſunk in that Fight: And <hi>Monk</hi> had a chain of Gold, and <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Lawſon,</hi> each of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> on the Contrary, pretended the Victory was on their ſide, becauſe ſaid they, they had obliged the <hi>English</hi> to quit their Coaſts which they had kept beſieged for ſeveral weeks ſpace, which was the end for which they fought, which exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe was the more plauſible, becauſe it was well known, that the <hi>English</hi> retired to their own Coaſts, the night after the Battle, tho' it was only to make a ſpeedy return with a powerfull recruit of Ammunition and Shipping, as it would ſoon after have proved, to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er terror of <hi>Holland,</hi> and perhaps to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction of their Sea power, before they could have had time to find means to recover themſelves, if kind Providence, minded to reſerve them for greater things, had not by a ſudden turn of the Government in <hi>England,</hi> diverted their impending fate, and procured them a ſpeedy Peace with that Nation.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29562:80"/> ſenſible detriment to his Country, was this. The Guards of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> to the Number of 400, marcht before, trailing their pikes and Colours, with the muzzles of their Muskets turn'd downwards, and their ſtocks covered with black cloth; After them followed 4 trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters, accompanied with a Herald armed Cap-a-Pee, who repreſented the Admiralty; next them were carried the great Admiral Flag, the little Standard, the Coat of Arms, the Gantlets, Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, Spurs of Knight-hood, and the Sword. And immediately before the Body was led the Funeral Horſe laden with all the Arms of the deceaſed, and cover'd over with a large Mantle of black Cloth, the corners of which were held up by ſome Sea Captains.</p>
            <p>After the body, marched the Commiſſioners of the Admiralty, followed by the three Sons of the deceaſed Admiral, his Sons-in-Law, and others of his near kindred; after them went the States General, the Council of State, the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the great Council, the Court, and the Chamber of Accounts of <hi>Holland,</hi> accompanied by the Magiſtrates, the Miniſters of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Council, and the Burghers of the <hi>Hague.</hi> In this manner the Corps was conducted to the Boat, amidſt the Tears and Lamentations of the people, to be conveyed to <hi>Delft,</hi> where he was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by 4 Companies of Burghers in Arms, and Buried in the Church there, and honoured at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment with a farewel ſalute of 3 Vollies of Musket ſhot.</p>
            <p>But the States General, to Immortalize his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and leave a laſting Monument to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of the moſt valiant Hero that ever appear'd upon the Ocean, and whoſe name alone had made their Enemies tremble, granted the ſum of 10000 Livers, for the erecting him a ſtately Tomb.</p>

The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of that Pedeſtal jetts out in a ſquare form, and bears upon its fore ſide, an Enchaſed Table of white Marble containing an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deſcription of the Battle that coſt <hi>Martin Tromp</hi> his life. On both ſides, on the right and left, are to be ſeen ſeveral Ornamental works in Relief, or raiſed work, of white Marble, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Crowns of Lawrel, Garlands of Fruits, and flowers, and Garnitures of Sea-ſhells.</p>
            <p>Upon this Pedeſtal lies the Statue of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral in compleat Armor, with the head reſting upon a piece of Cannon, the Body upon the Helm of a Ship. Behind the Body there is a ſquare Table of Marble, in which is enchaſed a Plate of touch-ſtone, on which is engraven in Golden Letters, the Epitaph we ſhall afterwards recite. Underneath upon the ſame piece of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are ſeveral pieces of raiſed work, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral little Cupids, of which two are the moſt remarkable, which ſtand in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Admiral's Statue, one of them holding the Arms of the States General, and the other thoſe of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſtfrieſland,</hi> having before and behind them ſeveral Cornets, Battle-Axes, Pikes, ancient Bucklers, and other ſorts of Roman Arms. On the left hand towards the Admiral's Feet, there is a Helmet garniſht with Plumes of Feathers, placed upon a Marble Cannon. Above thoſe Armorial pieces, we have ſpoken of, there is a flying <hi>Cupid</hi> holding a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Crown, and above him another having his arms extended, with a ſcroul in which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten theſe Latin Verſes.</p>

Two years after, Prince <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> made him Captain of a little Frigat which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried but 40 men, ſo that having run through all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Sea Employments, there was nothing done remarkable at Sea during the enſuing years, but he was preſent at it, giving every where ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proofs of his Great Vertue and Conduct.</p>
            <p>In the year 1629, <hi>De Hein</hi> who had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf famous by taking ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galleons la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Silver, being made Lieutenant Admiral of <hi>Holland,</hi> put again to Sea in the Ship called the <hi>Green Dragon,</hi> which was a very fleet Sailer, but was ſoon after unfortunately killed by <hi>Tromp</hi>'s ſide. The Teſtimony he gave of <hi>Tromp</hi> is altogether remarkable. He had, ſaid he, known many brave Captains, in whom he had however ſtill found ſome failing or other, but in <hi>Tromp</hi> he profeſſed he never had obſerved any thing but what was great and vertuous, and therefore judg'd him to poſſeſs all the happy Qualities neceſſary in an Admiral. The Ship that <hi>Heins</hi> was in, was, as we have ſaid, a very good Sailer, but after he was dead, it was by favour given to another and not to <hi>Tromp,</hi> at which, he was ſo ſenſibly diſpleaſed, that out of meer indignation he quitted the Sea, and retired into the Country, where he exerciſed an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that only at a diſtance related to Marine Affairs.</p>
            <p>In the year 1637 Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Dorp</hi> having quitted the ſervice, Prince <hi>Frederick Henry,</hi> upon the recommendation of the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> gave the Command of the Fleet to <hi>Tromp,</hi> in quality of Lieutenant Admiral, with a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Commiſſion only for one year: which time being expired, the Prince granted him a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of it with a more ample Commiſſion. In the ſequel, he got a great deal of Honour, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29562:85"/> ſignalized himſelf in divers Battles which he fought againſt the <hi>Dunkirkers,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo that he was lookt upon by all the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> to be the ableſt and moſt valiant Sea Commander of the Age in which he lived. He was ſo tenderly beloved by the Seamen, that both the Captains and Mariners uſed to call him their Father, and <hi>Tromp</hi> out of a Reciprocal love to them, uſed to call them likewiſe, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But there was nothing ſo admirable in him as the Moderation, and cool and ſedate Temper of blood which he ſhewed in the greateſt heat of a fight in which he Commanded. For he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as quiet and compoſed when he gave his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as if he had been at home in his own houſe under ſafe ſhelter from all dangers.</p>
            <p>But to recontinue the thred of our Diſcourſe, <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Ship which was quite diſabled to keep the Sea any longer, was carried out of the fight by Captain <hi>Aldertſz,</hi> and arrived about the Dusk of Night, before the Meuſe. The next day two Gentlemen came on board the Admiral, and delivered him a Letter from the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in which their High and Mightineſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him an account of the ſucceſs of the Battle, and of the deſtiny of their Fleet. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> anſwered the States, and in few words related to them all the Circumſtances of the Battle according to the beſt knowledge he had of them. The day following he entered into the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> where Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> came to him from <hi>Goree,</hi> and brought him a Letter from the States General, by which he was Ordered to remove into <hi>Evertſz</hi>'s Galleot, and to go along joyntly with him, in ſearch of the Fleet. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to which, they ſailed along by the Coaſt, and found Captain <hi>Taneman</hi> to the Northward of the Meuſe, whoſe Ship being already ſunk 14 Fathom deep under Water, ſhewed nothing but the very Tops of her M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:29562:86"/>
            <p>At about 2 miles from <hi>Scheveling,</hi> they found Captain <hi>Swart</hi> at Anchor, who Commanded a Ship fraighted by the <hi>

                  </gap>aſt-India</hi> Company. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> and <hi>Evertſz</hi> then Rowed off further into the Sea, to learn what news they could of the Enemies Fleet. The 13th of the ſame Month, they came towards the <hi>Texel,</hi> where they found the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet to be 84 ſail ſtrong of Men of War, beſides 12 more that were in the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> at <hi>Goree,</hi> or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> ſo that, if they gave a true account, the <hi>Dutch</hi> loſt in all but 9 Ships in the whole Fight, as has been already ſaid.</p>
            <p>The States General of the United Provinces being willing to perſwade all <hi>Europe,</hi> that it was not without ſome grounds, they gloried to have gained conſiderable advantages in that Battle, ſince they had thereby freed their Coaſts and Harbors from the oppreſſion of the <hi>English,</hi> who had a long time held them ſtraightly block'd up and beſieged, uſed all poſſible care to make their interrupted Commerce flouriſh again. For that deſign, they aſſembled a great Fleet of Merchant Ships, bound part of them to the North, and part to the Weſtward; beſides which, there were ſeveral others bound homewards from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and from divers parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> which waited in the <hi>Sound,</hi> or in the Ports of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> for a Convoy.</p>
            <p>Vice-Admiral <hi>de Wit</hi> to whom the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Fleet was then given, ſet ſail the 10th. of <hi>September,</hi> with a Fleet of 40 ſail, Compoſed of the Ships that had ſuffered the leaſt damage in the laſt fight. 70 Merchant Ships from the <hi>Texel,</hi> and 100 more from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lie</hi> came out and joyned him. On the 30th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> he arrived with this Potent Fleet near little <hi>Holms,</hi> where he met 5 <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships, and a great many other Merchant Ships coming from the <hi>Sound</hi> under the Convoy of 14 <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Men of War, who unmoored upon his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29562:86"/> and joyned themſelves to the Admiral's Flag. Beſides theſe, there joyned him above 160 more, coming from <hi>Mardon,</hi> and other Havens. And over and above all thoſe, there came to him from time to time re-inforcements of ſeveral men of War, from <hi>Holland,</hi> which Augmented his Fleet at laſt to the Number of 76 ſail of Men of War, which together with the Merchant Men, made up a Fleet of 400 ſail; who all came happily into the <hi>Texel</hi> or the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lie</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>November,</hi> without meeting any <hi>English,</hi> tho' they were then at Sea with a Fleet of 50 ſail of ſtrong Men of War. The States having reſolved to keep their Fleet out at Sea all Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Men of War that were to compoſe it kept about the <hi>Texel,</hi> to take in Proviſions of Victuals, when a furious Tempeſt ariſing, had like to have deſtroyed them. The Fleet then conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of 76 Men of War, as we have ſaid, beſides two Flutes laden with Ammunition and Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Aſſoon as the Wind began to freſhen, they ſet ſail towards the Main Sea, and came to an Anchor within 2 miles and a half to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Kykduin.</hi> The Wind freſhning again on the 9th. of <hi>November,</hi> before day, blew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſo fiercely and with ſo much violence, from the Weſt-North-Weſt, turning ſometimes full to the North-Weſt, that ſeveral Ships were driven upon their Anchors, and others having cut down their Main maſts run into the <hi>Texel,</hi> without conſidering the great danger they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by expoſed themſelves to. The night following the bluſtering Weather ſtill continued, and the next day grew ſo furious, mixt with a fierce ſtorm of hail, that Vice-Admiral <hi>de Wit</hi> and 10 other Ships of the Fleet were thereby driven from their Moorings, ſeveral periſh'd, and others were ſtranded upon the Coaſts.</p>
            <pb n="162" facs="tcp:29562:87"/>
            <p>On the third day the Tempeſt abated a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, when of ſo potent a Fleet there remained but 47 Ships, 23 of which had had all their Maſts and Rigging blown away cloſe by the board. But ſuch a diſaſter as that had been in ſome meaſure more ſupportable if it had not been unhappily follow'd by the ſad news of the loſs of 12 or 13 men of War that had likewiſe periſh't together with a Fleet laden with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and ſeveral Merchant Ships, and a great many people with them. There were ſome Ships all whoſe men were drown'd without ſo much as one Perſon eſcaping: And they which were left were ſo endamaged, that when the Weather grew calm, they were forced to return into their Harbours to repair and reſit themſelves. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the <hi>English</hi> Fleet come off at a much Cheaper rate, for after being very roughly uſed by the Tempeſt, the Parliament thinking them uncapable to keep the Sea any longer, ordered them to put into their Ports to be diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>About that time there was ſpread abroad in <hi>Holland</hi> a Lamentable report of the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition into which the <hi>Dutch</hi> priſoners in <hi>England</hi> were reduced, and the cruel treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reported to be uſed to them there, which exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a moſt raging and furious reſentment in all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at ſuch ſuppoſed barbarity. Their Number was about 900, who were ſaid to be moſt of them ſhut up in the then old decayed, unfiniſh't and uncovered College of <hi>Chelſey,</hi> between four bare walls, in the wide fields, expoſed to the open skie, and to all the rigours of the ſeaſon, laid only upon ſtraw without any thing to cover them: ſo that many of them not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that miſery died. Nay, and 'twas affirmed further, that the hard-heartedneſs of the <hi>English</hi> proceeded ſo far againſt thoſe poor wretches, as to forbid thoſe of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation that lived
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29562:87"/> at <hi>London,</hi> to aſſiſt them as they had before done 'till towards the end of the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving expended from the beginning to that time above 500 <hi>l.</hi> Sterlin in relieving them, ſo that coming afterwards to want that charitable aſſiſtance, many of them languiſh'd to death. Some of them looking upon the peril of an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable death as the leſſer evil of the two, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it before ſo many ſufferings, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make their eſcapes, tho' with the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hazard of breaking their necks, by clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering over the Walls, but when any of them were perceived ſo attempting, the Soldiers would not fail moſt mercileſly to ſhoot them, or elſe to run them through with their ſwords. But it muſt be conſidered indeed that this was the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a then lawleſs people, and no worſe than what they had uſed to their own Countrymen, and their own natural Prince, and his moſt faithful ſervants, and ſo is the leſs to be wondred at, and not imputable to that nation in more regular times. However notwithſtanding all thoſe cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſome ſtole away from the vigilance of their guards, in ſpite of all the exactneſs they could uſe, and amongſt the reſt, Captain <hi>Schellinger</hi> who was one of thoſe unhappy captives, found means to eſcape and to get into <hi>Holland,</hi> where he made a diſmal Relation of all thoſe inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But ſoon after, the Priſoners on both ſides were exchanged.</p>
            <p>During the laſt expedition that the Vice-Admirals <hi>de Wit</hi> and <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had newly made together, the States of <hi>Holland</hi> had been deliberating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the choice of a fit perſon worthily to ſupply the place of Lieutenant Admiral, vacant by the death of the Incomparable <hi>Tromp:</hi> And their opinions were ſo divided thereupon, that they knew not well what to determine in the matter. Vice-Admiral <hi>de Wit,</hi> they knew well enough to be a man that had given ſignal proofs of

On the other ſide, they were ſenſible enough, they could not make choice of another which was no more than his equal, and much leſs of one that was inferiour to him, without giving him an Extraordinary cauſe of Jealouſie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without doing him a manifeſt injuſtice; and yet, that if they ſhould not admit him to that Employment, it was to be feared, that the diſſention that would undoubtedly ariſe upon that occaſion amongſt the General Officers of the Fleet, might draw after it moſt pernicious and diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous conſequences, whenever they happened to come to an Engagement. At laſt therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having judiciouſly weighed an affair of ſuch high Importance, they thought fit to make choice of a Perſon as Recomendable for his Merit, as his Birth and noble Extraction, who was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the ancient and illuſtrious houſe of <hi>Waſſenaer,</hi> whoſe Valour and great Capacity in Marine affairs was known to all the World; And that was Mr. <hi>Opdam,</hi> Collonel of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Horſe, and Governour of <hi>Heuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> whoſe Father likewiſe formerly exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Employment.

            <p>At his arrival, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Conſul, and chief Merchants of his Nation came on board him, and with a ſenſible diſpleaſure delivered him ſome Letters from <hi>Sally,</hi> which related with how much inhumanity the <hi>Sid</hi> treated the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> upon the taking of a Flute from them near <hi>Mamora</hi> called the <hi>Hound,</hi> by Rear Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> and the <hi>Sid</hi> highly incenſed thereat, having by way of repriſal, ſeized 3 Merchant Ships of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> full freighted, had impriſoned all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and men in the ſaid Ships, and threatned to make them ſlaves, unleſs the Flute and her Cargo were ſpeedily reſtored.

            <p>Accordingly, on the 18th of <hi>July</hi> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> ſailed out of the <hi>Texel</hi> with 8 Men of War, and 55 Merchant Ships bound for <hi>France, Portugal, Spain,</hi> and other places in the Mediterranean; and on the 3d. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the bay of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> with a Fleet of 44 ſail; on the 7th. he paſt the <hi>Streights,</hi> ſteering his Courſe towards <hi>Malaga, Cartagena</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licant,</hi> into which places, ſome of the Merchant Ships entered. The reſt of them quitted <hi>de Ruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> near the Iſle of <hi>Formentera,</hi> which they had choſen for their place of Rendezvous, in caſe they ſhould come to be ſeparated by any accident. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> departed thence with deſign to go before <hi>Algiers,</hi> ſending the Captains, <hi>de Wilde,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:29562:93"/> Sweers,</hi> and <hi>Zaalingen,</hi> before him, to ſee what Ships they could diſcover riding before that Town, ſo famous for its Pyracies.</p>
            <p>On the 30th. he began to come in ſight of it, and coming up with the Captains he had ſent before, they reported to him, that they had been ſo near the Town, that they had ſeen people walking on the Cawſey, and diſcerned 5 Ships in the road, and 6 or 7 within the Mole. The ſame night <hi>de Ruiter</hi> advanced with his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, within Cannon ſhot of the Town, and Anchored in 42 Fathoms depth of Water. The 2 Yachts, the <hi>Pearl,</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> were already prepared for an Enterprize; and the better to deceive the Corſairs, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> Commanded all his Captains, to put up <hi>English</hi> Colours. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſhew'd themſelves upon ſome ſmall veſſels near the ſhore, but durſt not come very near the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Then the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains being all ſummoned on board the Admiral, a Council of War was held; wherein it was reſolved, that in the night by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Land Breezes, they ſhould make ſail, to Conduct, if it were poſſible, their Fire-Ships back by 3 men of War, up to the Brigantines to burn them, but ſo great a Calm laſted all the night, that it was hard to know on which ſide the Wind was. The next Morning it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill Calm, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> perceived that the 5 Brigantines that were in the Road the day before, were then retired within the Mole, ſo that it was not difficult to Judge by the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they were upon their guard.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:29562:94"/>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1654"/> Whereupon another Council of War, being called, it was reſolved, that ſince by reaſon of the Calm, it was impoſſible to undertake any thing upon the Enemy, they ſhould weigh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and make the beſt of their way towards <hi>Malaga;</hi> which accordingly was put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about noon. As the <hi>Dutch</hi> drew near that place, they diſcovered ſome Corſair Ships, to which they gave chace; and on the 17th. of <hi>September,</hi> they took a <hi>Tetuan</hi> Brigantine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with 20 <hi>Moors,</hi> whoſe Captain was a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Renegado named <hi>Arnando Dias,</hi> who had done a great deal of miſchief to the Chriſtians, and had cauſed very great loſſes to them, having in about 12 years time, made near 2000 ſlaves whom he had all cruelly ſold, and amongſt them, as 'twas credibly related, ſome of his own near kindred; and bragged ſeveral times, that he would treat his own Father after the ſame manner, if he fell into his hands; And therefore according to his Execrable merits, he was immediately hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up upon a Top-maſt.</p>
            <p>On the 9th. of the ſame Month, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> continued on his Courſe, and arrived two days after, in the bay of <hi>Gibraltar;</hi> the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, weighing Anchor, he repaſt the <hi>Streights,</hi> and ſteered his Courſe towards <hi>Cadiz,</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make for the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary.</hi> On the 27th. he diſcovered 2 Corſair Ships at the mouth of the <hi>Streights</hi> to the Eaſtward, and another to the South-Weſt-ward. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> gave chace to this laſt, as appearing to be the biggeſt of them. The Corſair made away as faſt as ſhe could, directly towards <hi>Arzila,</hi> a little Town in the Kingdom of <hi>Fez</hi> about 12 Leagues from <hi>Tangier.</hi> And it proved to be the Admiral's Ship of <hi>Algier,</hi> that was taken from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> but the year before, and by the <hi>Dutch</hi> was called <hi>the Wheel of Fortune,</hi> but by the <hi>Turks,</hi> named <hi>the Golden Palm-tree.</hi> That Ship was full as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29562:94"/> big as <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s own Admiral Ship, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried 38 Guns, and 250 men, amongſt whom were 50 Chriſtian ſlaves that were forced to ſerve on board her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>De Ruiter</hi> chaſed her as far as into the very Haven of <hi>Arzila,</hi> where with much ado ſhe made a ſhift to ſave her ſelf, after having loſt many of her men in the fight, and principally her Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain who loſt his life in the Skirmiſh. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet continuing on their Courſe, came and Anchored in the road of <hi>Sally,</hi> on the 1ſt. of <hi>October,</hi> after they had taken one <hi>Turkish</hi> Ship and a <hi>Tartan,</hi> and ſtranded a Renegado Corſair. <hi>De Ruiter,</hi> at his arrival ſaluted the Town with 9 Guns, the great Caſtle anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with 5, and the little one with 4, after which, according to his Commiſſion, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to enter into a Negotiation with the Deputies of <hi>Sall,</hi> in order to appeaſe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences they had with the United Provinces; but he being delayed ſeveral days without being able to do any thing, and in the mean while receiving advice, that the moſt part of the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi> Pyrates kept the paſſage of the <hi>Streights</hi> ſhut up, and returned daily from thence to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> with Prizes, he thought it was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him to ſtay in <hi>Sally</hi> road with all his whole Squadron; but calling thereupon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation of his Captains on board him, it was reſolved, that <hi>de Wilde,</hi> and Rear Admiral <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen,</hi> and Captain <hi>Zaalingen,</hi> ſhould ſail away towards the Streights, to give chaſe to the Corſairs. And accordingly they unmoor'd with the New Moon, ſteering towards <hi>Cadiz,</hi> whilſt on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, Captain <hi>Vander Zaan</hi> kept out a cruizing with two Men of War more. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> in the mean while ſtaid with two of the ſhips of his Squadron, before <hi>Sally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to purſue the Negotiation of the Treaty. In the midſt of which Tranſactions, on the 16 of <hi>October</hi> he
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29562:95"/> diſcovered between <hi>Sally</hi> and <hi>Mamora</hi> 3 Sail making towards <hi>Sally,</hi> but were kept back by the Calm Weather; Upon which, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> weighing Anchor, accompanied by Captain <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delaer,</hi> advanced with deſign to cut off their paſſage, the Corſairs having perceived them, made back as faſt as they could, to the main Sea again, the Wind being then North-North-Eaſt, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> uſed all poſſible endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to get up with them, but night coming on, he loſt ſight of them; However, ſome hours after having diſcovered them again, he boarded one of them about 3 in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the aſſiſtance of Oars, notwithſtanding the Calmneſs of the Weather. At his very firſt firing, the <hi>Turks</hi> got into their Boat, and fled away, leaving no body on Board but two Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes that were in the Ship. She was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Sailer of about 90 Tuns, that was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Turks</hi> near the Iſle of <hi>Madera.</hi> The 2 others were Corſairs of <hi>Algiers,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one carried 26, and the other 16 Guns, who made their eſcape by favour of a freſh gale of Wind that ſoon carried them out of Reach. The next day towards Evening, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Sally</hi> road again. In the mean while, the Negotiation for a Treaty having been brought upon a good foot by the Deputies on each ſide, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtood firm to their Pretentions, which were, that they ſhould receive an indemnification for their Ship that was taken, till at laſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeveral Conferences, the Treaty of Peace was concluded, and renewed on the 22d. of <hi>October</hi> upon the following Articles,<note place="margin">A Peace renewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Vice-Admiral <hi>de Wit</hi> putting out likewiſe from the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> with ſeveral men of War more, came and joyned the Fleet, which afterward ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſail, arrived at <hi>Copenhagen</hi> on the 29th. of the ſaid Month, and the next day, the States Ambaſſadors, adviſing them to continue on their way, they ſet ſail again to enter into the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Sea, ſo that 6 days after, the whole Fleet came to an Anchor in <hi>Dantzick</hi> road, being 42 ſail of Frigats and men of War,; <hi>viz.</hi> 7 of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> 24 of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> 7 of North-<hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 2 of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and 2 of <hi>Frieſland.</hi>

            <p>At the arrival of this Potent Fleet, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Termund,</hi> which is at the Mouth of the <hi>Viſtula</hi> in the Gulf of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> ſaluted them with ſeveral Guns, and immediately after, ſome Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſons came in a Galliot from the Town on board the Admiral, to ſalute him, and to let him know the Joy the whole regency was in at his arrival. Mr. <hi>Fabricius</hi> Penſionary of the Town, and famous for his great learning, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Opdam,</hi> from the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29562:99"/> Magiſtrates, and invited him in their name, to be pleaſed to come aſhore into their Town; and the publick rejoycings and other tranſports of joy which all the People ſhew'd upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, laſted ſeveral days. The States had had notice given them ſome time before, as from the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that his ſaid Majeſty had form'd a deſign to block up the Town of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> and afterwards to beſiege it, and that he prayed their High and Mightineſſes to be pleaſed to ſuſpend their Commerce during that time, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all Merchant Ships belonging to their State, to go thither to take in any fraight. But the unexpected arrival of that Fleet broke all the deſigns of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> and tho' it was ſent out for no other end but to free the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea from the Yoke of that power, yet it was ſtrong enough to make all the fair hopes that Crown had conceived of Compaſſing ſo great an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize as that vaniſht to into ſmoak, and that without any effuſion of blood. On the 1ſt. of <hi>September</hi> following there appeared likewiſe at Sea, a Fleet of 9 Daniſh Men of War under the Conduct of Admiral <hi>Lindenhout,</hi> which came alſo and Anchored before <hi>Dantzick.</hi> They had the ſame deſign as had the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, which was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that Hanſeatick Town and the Freedom of Navigation. In the mean time, the States De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, <hi>Slingeland, Van Dorp, de Hubert,</hi> and <hi>Jabrandt</hi> being entred into a Negotiation at <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing</hi> with the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Plenipotentiaries about a Treaty of Alliance, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet that continued ſtill before <hi>Dantzick</hi> Contributed much to advance it, ſo that it was concluded and ſigned on the 1ſt. of <hi>September,</hi> on both ſides.</p>
            <p>The States knowing the aboveſaid Treaty with <hi>Swedeland,</hi> was upon the point of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Daniſh Squadron was already ſailed away ever ſince the 25th. of <hi>September,</hi> for <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> whither the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had recalled it, as being ill ſatisfied at the Treaty Concluded with <hi>Swedeland</hi> without his privity. In fine, on the 6th. of <hi>October,</hi> the moſt part of the Troops that were on board the Fleet, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and diſtributed into the 12 Ships that were to ſtay in the road; only 280 men which there was no room to place there, entred into the Town by the Magiſtrates leave, and towards the Evening, the Fleet ſailed away. But before his departure, Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Opdam</hi> received a preſent from the Magiſtrates of a very fine Silver Ewer with a croſſed handle, valued at 600 Crowns.</p>
            <p>Not long after the departure of the Grand Fleet, Vice Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> received likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the States, to quit the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, and to return into <hi>Holland,</hi> with his Squadron.

The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair paſſed in this manner: Tbe Soldiers that were in the firſt of theſe Ships revolted againſt their Officers, ſaying they were inrol'd for the Service of <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick</hi> and not for the King of <hi>Swedeland;</hi> they were by the ill weather forced to Anchor near <hi>Heel,</hi> where they conſtrained their Officers and their Pilot, to carry them to <hi>Dantzick.</hi> Being come into the <hi>Viſtula,</hi> they reported, that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Koningſmark</hi> lay at Anchor in the ſame place, upon which Advice <hi>3</hi> Galliots were ſent towards him, who attackt him before noon, ſo that he was made priſoner in ſight of our Fleet. The ſame Evening I went with the Governor of the Town, to viſit him in the Fort, <hi>Termund;</hi> and he told us, he came from <hi>Stetin,</hi> with deſign to go to <hi>Pilau.</hi> There was in this Rencounter, one man killed, and <hi>5</hi> wounded.</q>
            <p>To report the misfortune of General <hi>Kon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingſmark</hi> with its principal Circumſtances, you muſt know, that at his departure from <hi>Stetin,</hi> there was a ſhip which had on board her, 130 <hi>Scotch</hi> Soldiers, that ſet ſail at the ſame time with him, ſteering her courſe towards <hi>Pilau;</hi> but a Tempeſt, and a contrary Wind having kept them back 10 days upon the Sea, the Ship being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loaden with ſoldiers, fell a Leaking ſo very much that ſhe could no longer keep the Sea, which obliged the ſoldiers to take arms againſt their Officers, and the Maſter of the ſhip, whom they forced at length to Land them at <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick,</hi> where they informed the Magiſtrates where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts <hi>Koningſmark</hi> lay at Anchor. Upon that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:29562:101"/> Report, they preſently mann'd out 3 Galliots which were detacht againſt him on the 20th. of <hi>October,</hi> about break of day, and between 9 and 10 a Clock before noon, attackt his ſhip, juſt when General <hi>Koningſmark</hi> was buſied in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Sermon. The preacher perceiving the Enemies, gave notice of it to the General, who thereupon Commanded the Pilot to cut the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor-Cables, and with all poſſible haſte to make all the ſail away he could: But the Pilot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering him, that it was impoſſible to do it, he gave Orders to his men to do every man his beſt to defend themſelves; But before they could get into a poſture of defence the Enemies boarded him, <hi>Koningſmark</hi> retiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Maſter's Cabbin, demanded Quarter, which was granted to him and all his Men. So that this General, as great a Commander as he was, yet for want of skill in the Art of fighting at Sea; that skirmiſh being perhaps the firſt of that kind he ever was in, was forced to yield himſelf at the diſcretion of the Victors, who carried him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to <hi>Dantzick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return again to the States Fleet, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Admiral <hi>Opdam</hi> entred on the 6th. of <hi>November</hi> into <hi>Helvoetſluys</hi> with a part of the men of War that compoſed the Fleet, and the reſt of them almoſt at the ſame time got into the <hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1657"/> on the 20th. of <hi>January,</hi> he arrived at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> where he Anchored the 28th. of the ſame Month, he ſet ſail again, and paſt the <hi>Streights,</hi> with 5 Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſhips; two days after meeting with <hi>de Wilde,</hi> and <hi>Vander Zaan,</hi> between <hi>Gibraltar</hi> and <hi>Malaga,</hi> he ſhewed them the States Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for them to joyn his Admiral Flag: On the 19th of <hi>February,</hi> he arrived in <hi>Legorn</hi> Road, with 9 Merchant ſhips, whilſt the reſt ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves from the Squadron, ſteer'd their Courſe towards <hi>Malaga</hi> and <hi>Alicant</hi> whither they were bound. On the 26th. unmooring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he was informed by a <hi>Hamburgher,</hi> that 2 <hi>French</hi> Privateers, had appeared in thoſe parts, and that three more were Equipping at <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The loſſes the Privateers had cauſed to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> for ſeveral years paſt, in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Seas, and eſpecially in the Mediterranean were very great, and ſenſible. For when the Sieur <hi>Boreel,</hi> Ambaſſador from the United Provinces arrived at the Court of <hi>France</hi> towards the end of the year 1650, there were already 168 <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant ſhips taken by <hi>French</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, ſince which, they were reckoned to have taken 160 more, ſo that the whole Number of all thoſe prizes amounted to near 328 Ships which the Privateers of that Nation had taken, Detained, Pillaged, or Confiſcated without any other grounds than th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29562:102"/> Theſe damages were reckoned at above 30 Millions of Livers. <hi>France</hi> even then in thoſe early days, when ſhe was ſo miſerably torn and rent with inteſtine diviſions, yet begun to make her Neighbours feel ſome effects of her Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in a time when one would have thought ſhe had more need of Courting the Amity of the United Provinces, yet took a hank to attempt upon their Liberty by all thoſe injuſtices; which ought to have been a warning piece to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> and an aſſured preſage for the time to come, to have made them fear much greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtices from her afterwards whenever ſhe ſhould become Abſolute Miſtreſs of her then diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people; what inſtances ſoever the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral could make to obtain ſatisfaction for ſo many damages, the Kings Council, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Admiralty took a Reſolution to Reſtore nothing; ſo that what great juſtice ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Ambaſſador <hi>Boreel</hi> had on his ſide, to ſolicit the releaſe of them in the name of the States, and in ſpite of all the diligence he could uſe for that end, he never was able to obtain any thing, the indulgence ſhewn by the Court to thoſe Privateers its Subjects, was ſo great that it encouraged them ſo extremely, that there was no poſſibility of obtaining the releaſe of any one Prize. Whereupon, the States General being at length wearied out with making ſo many fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Complaints, and apprehending leſt their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver great Patience might ruin their Commerce and their Subjects, they reſolv'd at laſt to free themſelves from all thoſe Robberies by force of Arms, and to make uſe of repriſals. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they Ordered <hi>de Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ter</hi> to attack the <hi>French</hi> Men of War that came out of the Ports of Provence to make excurſions in the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean, and to do all he could to take or ſink them. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> then had been informed, as we have ſaid, by a <hi>Hamburger,</hi> that 2 <hi>French</hi> Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29562:102"/> that had Plundred him were ſtill roving about thoſe Seas. And on the 28th. of <hi>February</hi> at break of day, he diſcovered 2 ſhips near the Iſle of <hi>Corſica,</hi> at about 3 miles diſtance from him, which ſeemed to look ſharp after him, but when they came nearer within about a Mile of him, they begun to find they had to deal with men of War, and not with Merchant ſhips, which made them betake themſelves to flight. However, about noon the ſhips of both Parties met between <hi>Gorgona</hi> and the Iſland of <hi>Corſica,</hi> without firing ſo much as a Gun on either ſide. Then <hi>de Ruiter</hi> Commanded the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the biggeſt Caper to enter into his Boat, and come on board him; but the Captain contented himſelf to ſend his Lieutenant whom <hi>de Ruit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> detained, ſending word to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain again that if he refuſed to obey his ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he would immediately board him, and would make him ſuffer the puniſhment due to his obſtinacy: At this ſecond Command he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Boat, and came on board the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral. Whilſt <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and <hi>de Wilde</hi> kept cloſe to the great Caper, the Captain <hi>Ooms,</hi> and <hi>Vander Zaan</hi> gave chace to the other, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Commanded the Captain to come on board the Admiral, which he having done, <hi>Vander Zaan</hi> detained him likewiſe. So that the 2 Privateers ſeeing there was no hopes to eſcape, drew in their Guns out of their port-holes, and throwing down their Arms, ſubmitted themſelves to the Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Victor. They were 2 <hi>Swedish</hi> Ships which ſome time before had been preſented to the French King, but were afterwards Armed out by ſome Private Perſons, and employed in the Pyrating Trade. The biggeſt of them called the Queen, had on board her 230 men, and 32 guns, whereof 30 were braſs, the leſſer which was called the Hunter, carried 182 men, and 28 guns, whereof 18 were braſs. The <hi>French</hi> Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:29562:103"/> that were on board them, were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted in 3 Barks, to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> but the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Lieutenants were kept by the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and their ſhips carried to <hi>Cadiz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The news of the taking of theſe 2 Privateers made a great noiſe in <hi>France,</hi> the Court there looking upon it as the moſt hanious attempt that <hi>de Ruiter</hi> could have committed in time of profound Peace. And Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> who then had the chief management of all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Kingdom, pretended to make it paſs for an outrage that deeply wounded the Glory of his Maſter, and was a cruel ſtroke at his Grandure, and at that deference the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to have for it. They gave out, that thoſe ſhips were the Kings, and that it was an intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece of Boldneſs, to offer to attackt and ſeize them. And therefore in revenge, Expreſs orders were ſent to all the Harbours in the Kingdom, immediately to ſeize all Ships, Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes, and effects belonging to the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> which was executed accordingly. The Haughty and Imperious manner with which the Court of <hi>France</hi> treated the United Provinces on ſuch an occaſion as that, ſurpriſed them ſo much the more, becauſe the King having at firſt imputed that pretended Hoſtile attempt wholly to <hi>De Ruiter,</hi> believed he had done it without the knowledge or conſent of his Maſters, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing leſs, than to ſee their Subjects to be ill treated by the confiſcation of the ſhips and goods they had in that Kingdom. And that way of proceeding ſeemed ſo much the harder upon them, in that the <hi>French</hi> Court had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to the Execution of it without any warning given to the States, or deſiring to know of them, whether they approved or diſapproved of that Action of <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> and without ſo much as ſuffering their High and Mightineſſes, after having ſo often reiterated by their Ambaſſadors ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29562:103"/> great and juſt Complaints of the damages they ſuffered by the <hi>French</hi> Privateers, to do themſelves Juſtice. The States of <hi>Holland,</hi> though they had the greateſt intereſt of any of the Provinces, in a Commerce with <hi>France,</hi> were for intirely forbidding all Trade with that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; after they had ſeized and ſtopt all French ſhips and effects in <hi>Holland,</hi> and all the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. But the States General not being ſo much concerned at what paſt in <hi>France,</hi> as the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> That Reſolution was let fall, and came to nothing. All that they could do, was only, to prevail with the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to Summon Deputies to the <hi>Hague,</hi> from all the Colleges of the Admiralty, to Conſult, about Arming out a Fleet of 48 men of War, which they reſolved to put out to Sea; with Orders, to give private notice to all Pilots and Maſters of Merchant ſhips, to avoid the Ports of France. The States writ alſo to Mr. <hi>Boreel</hi> their Ambaſſador in <hi>France,</hi> to repreſent to His Majeſty the injuſtice that was done them, in order to obtain a diſcharge of the ſhips, and Merchandizes, that were ſeized; as likewiſe all the Inſupportable Robberies Committed upon their Subjects for ſeveral years together by the <hi>French</hi> Privateers; without forgetting the 2 Capers taken by <hi>de Ruiter.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel</hi> had prevented theſe Orders of the States before he received them. For immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the abovemention'd Reſolution of the Court, he demanded Audience of the King, in Order to Repreſent to him his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Which being granted him, He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated very fully and at large, <hi>That it had been but fit before his Majeſty had proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further, to notifie to the States General of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, his Mrs. the reaſons that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Court to take Reſolutions ſo prejudicial to them, that the ſaid States on their ſide, might
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:29562:104"/> enter into Conſideration how to give his Majeſty all agreeable ſatisfaction on that Subject. After which, he excuſed</hi> de Ruiter, <hi>as far as the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation he had been able to get of the matter, would permit, and according to the reports that were ſpread abroad of his late Enterprize, and of that attempt which was the Subject of the Courts Complaint. He paſſed on next to the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Subjects of their High and Mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes had ſuffered for ſo many years, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual depredations which the</hi> French <hi>Privateers had Committed, and continued ſtill to Commit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Merchant Ships, notwithſtanding the ſo often repeated inſtances to the Contrary, in the Court of</hi> France, <hi>and always in vain. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that in the ſpace of</hi> 9 <hi>years, as we have ſaid, there had been about</hi> 328 <hi>Merchant Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the States Subjects, Taken or Plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; He made mention likewiſe of</hi> 58 <hi>ſentences given againſt</hi> French <hi>Privateers, which he had ſtill in his hands, without ever having been able to get any of them put in Excution, through the fault of the Courts of juſtice that were too indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to thoſe Privateers, which made them ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſeditious, that they had ventured even to attempt upon the Authority of his Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries at</hi> Thoulon, <hi>by driving them away like miſerable wretches; that the</hi> Dutch <hi>Conſul na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> de la Fleur, <hi>who reſided at</hi> Thoulon, <hi>was attackt in the ſtreets by thoſe villains, who char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with unmercifull blows, and would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have Aſſaſſinated him, if he had not found means to eſcape out of the reach of their fury, with great hazard of his life; and all that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Reaſon, than becauſe he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into the hands of his Majeſties Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, the ſentences rendred againſt them, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to get them put effectually in Execution. In fine, he intreated the King, that ſufficient time might be granted him, to inform the States his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:29562:104"/> of the Subject of his Majeſties Complaint; and that in the mean while, he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuspend the Execution of the Orders that were given to ſeize the Ships and effects of his Nation; as not at all doubting, but that the States would give his Majeſty all reaſonable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi>

            <p>The King having heard him very quietly, made him this Anſwer: <hi>I have ſent Orders to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To which they anſwered him, that as to what concerned the taking of the ſaid two ſhips, and the Conduct of the States in that matter, they pretended to give him ſuch a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable explication thereupon as ſhould make it ſo clear to him, that he himſelf would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all the Juſtice to the States. In the mean while, the States of <hi>Holland</hi> among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther propoſitions made there, had Voted in the Aſſembly of the States General, that to oblige the <hi>French</hi> King to ſubmit to reaſon, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to forbid all Commerce in any of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes of <hi>France;</hi> to ſtop and ſeize all Ships and effects belonging to the <hi>French,</hi> and to take all their Ships they could meet with at Sea. That further it would be requiſite, to Augment
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:29562:105"/> the Fleet they had reſolved to Arm out, with 12 Ships of War more, to render it the more Potent. In Conſequence of all which Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, an Ordinance was publiſh d ſign'd the 26th. of <hi>April,</hi> by virtue of which, all the Ships, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, Moneys, Effects, Letters of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and Debts, which ſhould be found to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>French</hi> in the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> were to be ſeized and Confiſcated. After which, the States General, at the ſollicitation of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> publiſh'd another Ordinance dated the 11th of <hi>May,</hi> by which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the importation of Salt, Wines, and Fruits, and all other Commodities of the growth of <hi>France,</hi> and all Merchandizes of their Manufactures.</p>
            <p>In fine, there was a great deal of reaſon to fear, that theſe growing troubles would quickly degenerate into a cruel War between the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and the United Provinces: But thoſe two powers reflecting ſeriouſly upon the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and Calamities ſuch a War would aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring upon the people on both ſides, <hi>France</hi> became more tractable and peaceable; And <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> having no other end than to preſerve Peace with that Crown, it was at laſt agreed on both ſides, that the Ships and Effects of both Nations ſhould be mutually releaſed; that the two Ships the Queen and the Hunter, taken by <hi>de Ruiter</hi> ſhould be reſtored, and that for the future, ſuch proper meaſures ſhould be taken, as might be effectual to prevent the hapning of any more like diſorders.</p>
            <p>During theſe intervening tranſactions, <hi>de Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> lying at an Anchor, in <hi>Cadiz</hi> Road, Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the 7th. of <hi>April,</hi> a Re-inforcement of 6 Men of War, Commanded by the Captains, <hi>Verveen, Vander Hulſt, Sweers, Kampen, Schat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>Adelaar.</hi> So that having then under his Conduct a Squadron of 12 men of War, he reſolved, to go again before <hi>Sally.</hi> In Order
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:29562:105"/> to which, he had beforehand written in the Month of <hi>January</hi> preceeding, to <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul of the Dutch Nation for the Coaſt of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> reſiding at <hi>Sally,</hi> that he intended, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the Orders of his Maſters, to come to <hi>Sally</hi> again at the ſpring of the year, to put a finiſhing hand to the Treaty of Peace already begun the year before; and that therefore for that effect, he charged him in the name of the States, to give notice of it to Prince <hi>Sid Abdala,</hi> and to diſpoſe all things in ſuch a manner, that at his arrival, they might proceed on both ſides to the ſpeedy Execution and Compleating of it without any delay. He accordingly arrived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Sally,</hi> on the 18th of <hi>April,</hi> two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 4 Ships he had detacht out of his Squadron to give chace to the Corſairs, had rejoyned him: And hearing at his arrival, that the Treaty was already concluded, he went back and Anchored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at <hi>Cadiz.</hi>

            <p>In <hi>September,</hi> Vice-Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> received Letters from the States General, and from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, with orders to cruize upon the Coaſts of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to joyn the Fleet of 13 men of War which the States were ſending that way under the Command of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Opdam.</hi> For the differences the United Provinces had had with <hi>France,</hi> having engaged them for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, to Arm out that Force, they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make uſe of it after they were appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring Portugal to reaſon, that it might not be ſaid, they had been at all that great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for nothing.

               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:29562:106"/> Fleet that was to come from <hi>Braſile,</hi> and againſt all other Ships belonging to that Nation, and ſhould endeavour to take them, in order to facilitate thereby an Accommodation with that Crown, and force it to give an account for all its uſurpations; which obliged them likewiſe, to ſend ſome Deputies along with Lieutentant Admiral <hi>Opdam,</hi> into <hi>Portugal;</hi> adding, That if the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ships offered to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> ſhould fight them, and do his beſt to take, or ſink them.</p>
            <p>The Fleet deſigned for the Ocean, under the Command of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Opdam;</hi> ſail'd then out of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the 5th. of <hi>September</hi> Conſiſting of 12 Men of War, 1 Advice Yacht, and 1 Flute laden with Proviſions. They came to an Anchor on the 25th. in the mouth of the <hi>Tagus</hi> near <hi>Lisbon.</hi> The ſame day the Sieurs <hi>Ten Hove</hi> and <hi>de Wit,</hi> Envoys from the States, going into a Yacht, went up the River, and two days after, were admitted to an Audience of the Queen Mother who then held the Reins of the Government, aſſiſted by ſome Grandees of the Kingdom, during the minority of the King her Son. The Envoys then Repreſented their Grievances, and demanded reſtitution of all that had been taken from the States in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile</hi> and elſewhere, and an indemnification for all their loſſes. But the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> after ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, anſwered, that they were reſolved to Reſtore nothing? No, not ſo much as one foot of Land. So poſitive an Anſwer as that put an end in an inſtant to their Negotiation. Some days before, that Court had put out an Order, to forbid all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and St. <hi>Hubes,</hi> to ſtir out of thoſe Ports till further Order. In the mean while, the States Envoys ſet on work the <hi>Dutch</hi> Conſul, named <hi>Vander Hoeve;</hi> who u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all imaginable ipmortunities at the Court of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to obtain a Liberty of Commerce, ſince
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29562:106"/> as he alledged, the States Fleet had not yet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any Act of Hoſtility againſt the <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Repreſenting to them at the ſame time, that the ſeizure and ſtoppage they had newly made of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, was like to be the <hi>Plreudium</hi> of a world of Miſchiefs.: But with all he could ſay, he could obtain nothing of them but a few fair promiſes without any effect. The Envoys therefore ſeeing they did but loſe their time there to no purpoſe, Demanded their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of leave: But Anſwer was made them, that the Queen was ſo indiſpoſed that ſhe was not in a Condition to give them Audience at that time. Upon which, they delivered to <hi>Pedro Vierra de Silva,</hi> the Secretary of State, a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſealed up, telling him withal, that they were very ſenſibly troubled, they could not take leave of the Queen in the uſual Form, by reaſon of her Majeſties indiſpoſition, and that therefore they prayed him to deliver her Majeſty that Letter, which in ſubſtance imported, that ſince they had uſed all the means they could, to terminate the differences between the two Nations in an amicable manner without any ſucceſs, they had Order from the States their Maſters, to declare War againſt the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they did; after which going again on board their Yacht, they joyned the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet the 23d. of <hi>October,</hi> where they informed Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Admiral <hi>Opdam</hi> of all that had paſſed. On the 26th. of the ſame Month, <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Squadron joyned the Admirals Flag, and the Fleet by that Junction, was reinforced to the Number of 27 or 28 men of War. During the time that Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Opdam</hi> continued on the Coaſts of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſome <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ships or other veſſels laden with their Merchandizes were taken; but the Booty taken off of <hi>Roxont</hi> was much more conſiderable; For in the night time, a Part of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Fleet of about 40
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:29562:107"/> ſail coming from <hi>Braſile</hi> Laden with Sugar, fell into the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, and tho the darkneſs of the night favoured their fight, by ſtealing them from their Enemies fight, yet 20 of them were taken. There were ſtill 44 more with their Convoy that remained behind, being kept back by a Tempeſt, againſt whom the <hi>Hollanders</hi> for ſome days cruiz'd, watching for their coming, but ſeeing they appeared not, and being uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were not already gotten into ſome ſafe Port, they took a Reſolution to prevent Winter, by retiring home to their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, before the Stormy Weather came in. And accordingly, they arrived in <hi>Holland</hi> with all their Prizes at the beginning of <hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year following, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was ſent again to the Coaſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> with a Fleet of 22 Ships of War; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1658"/> But the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> conſidering of what great Conſequence it was for them, to preſerve their Sea Forces, and how dangerous to hazard them in a Battle, kept their Fleet within their Ports, being perſwaded, that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would, as it did laſt year, force the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> to quit their Coaſts; ſo that <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was able to do them no other harm that Expedition, than only to interrupt their Commerce, and alarm their whole Country.</p>
            <p>We have above related, what means the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Provinces uſed, to break the deſigns of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> in the year 1656, and to free <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick,</hi> and the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea from the oppreſſion of that Power. That War which had made the States ſo uneaſie, and put them to ſo much expence, was followed by another much more bloody and dangerous. For <hi>Frederick</hi> the III. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Monarch Employed with his whole Forces in proſecuting the War he had with <hi>Poland,</hi> and conſidering, that was a fair occaſion for him to ſtrike in, and Revenge his Father, <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> the Vth's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:29562:107"/> who about 15 years before was oppreſſed by his Arms, and had part of his Dominions taken from him, he without any heſitation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf, being inflamed on one ſide, with the deſire of Revenge, and on the other, put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the ſecret allurements of a certain Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power. And accordingly marching his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into the Country of <hi>Bremen</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of General <hi>Bilde,</hi> he attackt and took ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places belonging to the <hi>Swedes.</hi> But For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that had gone along with his Arms in their happy beginning proving afterwards Jadiſh to him, deſerted him to that degree, that he ſoon ſaw himſelf at the point of loſing all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. For <hi>Charles Guſtavus,</hi> King of <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Quitting <hi>Poland</hi> immediately upon that News, came haſtning to the Aſſiſtance of what more nearly concerned him, and fell with all his forces into <hi>Hoſtein</hi> belonging to <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſo that by that Diverſion, he forced General <hi>Bilde</hi> to Quit the Dutchy of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and to retire to <hi>Frederickſode.</hi> But that place being ſituated upon the little <hi>Belt</hi> that ſeparates the Iſle of <hi>Funen</hi> from the Firm land of <hi>Jutland,</hi> was ſoon reduced under the obedience of <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> King <hi>Guſtavus</hi> ſtopt not the Career of his Conqueſts there, but paſſing his Army which was almoſt all Horſe, over the Ice, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Iſle of <hi>Funen,</hi> where he put to the Sword all that oppoſed his Triumphant Arms: In that paſſage, the Ice hapning to break in a certain place, 2 Enſigns and the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Coach were ſwallowed up. <hi>Odonſee,</hi> the Capital Town of the Iſland yielded without reſiſtance, and the Town of <hi>Nyburg</hi> was alſo taken.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles Guſtavus</hi> being eager to carry the Terror of Arms his yet further, Conſulted with his Generals, to reſolve, whether it were practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable for him to paſs his Army over the Ice, to enter into the Iſle of <hi>Zealand.</hi> But they being

But <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who was a Couragious and Daring Prince, was willing to prove Fortune that had ſo far ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his Arms, and reſolved to attempt that undertaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he lookt upon as what would Compleat all his Labours. In the mean while Sr. <hi>Thomas Meadow</hi> Ambaſſador from the Protector <hi>Cromwel,</hi> at the Court of <hi>Denmark,</hi> deſirous to put a ſtop to the Conqueſts of that Prince, diſpatcht a Courier to <hi>Funen,</hi> with Letters in which he made him ſome overtures for Peace. King <hi>Guſtavus</hi> obſerving, that the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier had paſt upon the Ice over the Grand <hi>Belt</hi> on horſe back, concluded, it would be ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bear his Army, and therefore fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing, that the cold Augmented, inſtead of abating, he advanced the very next morning without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining any longer in ſuſpence, towards the Iſle <hi>Langeland,</hi> and from thence into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Laland,</hi> where the Town of <hi>Naskou</hi> was reduced to his obedience. From thence he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Arms into the Iſle of <hi>Falſter,</hi> where he took the Fort Royal, <hi>Nikoping,</hi> after which, having croſſed the <hi>Belt,</hi> he entered into the Iſle of <hi>Zealand,</hi> that is to ſay, into the heart of the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Dominions, and immediately got poſſeſſion of the Town of <hi>Wisburg,</hi> and was juſt ready to march at the head of his Army, before <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> when the Ambaſſador from the Court of <hi>England</hi> arrived, to preſent him a Mediation for a Peace. At his firſt interviews with him, King <hi>Charles Guſtavus</hi> finding himſelf in the midſt of ſo many Proſperities, refuſed it,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:29562:108"/> but at laſt, growing more tractable, he conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Project of Peace that was drawn up and Concluded at <hi>Touſtrup</hi> the 28th. of <hi>February,</hi> and on the 8th. of <hi>March</hi> following, after it had been more amply examined, it was ratified at <hi>Rotſchild.</hi> That Treaty was altogether diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and to the United Provinces, becauſe it was therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed between the two Princes of the North, to ſhut up the <hi>Sound,</hi> and ſuffer no Forreign Man of War to paſs into the Baltick Sea. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> by reaſon of the Conqueſts <hi>Guſtavus</hi> had newly made, to yield up to him the Propriety of a good part of his Dominions, namely <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon at laſt, the K. of <hi>Sweden</hi> being deſirous fully to gratifie his Ambition, and puſh forward his great deſigns to their utmoſt extent, made a deſcent in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> with a powerfull Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſle of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and whilſt his Troops were landing there, he made his Fleet advance before <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> to form the ſiege of it; which was ſo effectually done, that it may be ſaid, that if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuccor'd it, in all appearance, the Triumphant <hi>Guſtavus</hi> would have reduced that Capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his obedience, and put a Period to the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> tho' formerly its Miſtreſs;

For the Security of their Commerce in the North, that ſupplied them with a great part of their Riches, and with Naval Stores, and other Neceſſaries for Building and Maintaining their Shipping, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their Sea-power; by which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to carry on their Traffick all over the reſt of the World, and to ſecure indeed their all, both by Sea and Land, wholly depending upon their brisk and timely Interpoſition, in that critical Juncture, ſuffered them no longer to heſitate in their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. And therefore the States determined in ſo preſſing an occaſion, to aſſemble all the Ships of War, that were in a Condition to put to Sea, in order to form a conſiderable Fleet; the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of which was conferred upon Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>Opdam;</hi> the other General Officers were, the Vice-Admirals <hi>de Wit,</hi> and <hi>Floriſz.</hi> They em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked alſo on Board that Fleet Thirty eight Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Regular Infantry, in all about Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, with deſign to throw ſome of them into <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and the reſt into the Caſtle of <hi>Kro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburg,</hi> upon the <hi>Sound.</hi> The Fleet then being equipped with an incredible Diligence, Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>Opdam</hi> ſet ſail the 17th of <hi>October;</hi> it was compoſed of 38 Ships of War, and ſix Flutes, laden with Ammunition and Proviſions, of four Fire-ſhips, and ſix Galleots.</p>
            <p>About the end of the ſame Month, the Fleet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the North-eaſt of <hi>Jutland:</hi> But in the mean while, the Caſtle of <hi>Kronenburg</hi> had ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

It's true, the Danger was very great, but the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was glorious, ſince it aimed at no leſs than at the Deliverance of a diſtreſſed King; who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having loſt all his Dominions, was ready to fall himſelf into the Hands of his Enemies. The 3d of <hi>November,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, by a contrary Wind, was obliged to anchor behind the <hi>Lap,</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Sound.

About Ten a Clock in the Forenoon the Two Fleets engaged in a Cruel Fight, in View of the King of <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of the Queen, and of the Princeſs his Siſter, Wife to the Count <hi>de la Guarde,</hi> as alſo of eldeſt Son of the Prince of <hi>Holſtean Gollorp,</hi> and of ſeveral other great Lords of the Court, who, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Caſtle of <hi>Kronenburg,</hi> were joynt Spectators of that Bloody and Terrible Fight. The <hi>Swedes,</hi> at firſt, bent all their principal Forces againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> Lieutenant-Admiral, and his Two Vice-Admirals, as thinking, if they could but diſable the Generals of their Enemy's Fleet, it would be no hard matter for them to gain the Victory over the reſt, when they ſhould want Heads to command them. And, in effect, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning did not ſucceed amiſs to them, at firſt: For Vice-Admiral <hi>De Wit,</hi> after having ſignaliz'd himſelf to the utmoſt, was mortally wounded; and his Ship taken for want of Help; but he Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Ship ſinking immediately after, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remained to the Enemies but his Body.

He had received ſeveral Shot between Wind and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which latter had gain'd already Five or Six Foot deep in his Ship, and his Prow was on Fire: His Maſts, his Rigging and all his Sails were ſhot down cloſe by the Board, ſo that he was reduc'd into a very pitiful Condition, when Captain <hi>Van Nes</hi> advanc'd one of the foremoſt, to his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.

He had on Board him Thirty ſeven Men killed, and about One hundred wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but he triumphed over all thoſe Diſaſters, by his great Bravery and wiſe Conduct. But if the General Officers of the States Fleet happened to be ill treated, thoſe of the <hi>Swedes</hi> fared never the better for it: For Admiral <hi>Wrangel,</hi> and Vice-Admiral <hi>Bielkenſtern,</hi> and ſeveral others, having their Ships ſhot through and through, and all ſhattered, were forced to retire out of the Fight.

There was never any thing more bloody than that ſhock, nor was there ever any Courage appear'd ſo undaunted as that ſhewn by the Allies in that Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that the <hi>Swedes</hi> being no longer able to endure ſo fierce and obſtinate an attack, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their ground, and retired in Confuſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Bridge. But the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> purſued them ſo cloſe, that they entred with them into the Town, ſet it on fire in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and then quitted it again. However, the fire did no great damage, becauſe it was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quench'd by the diligence of the Enemies. The day following <hi>de Ruiter</hi> detacht away 4 men of War, to go and cruize between the Iſles of <hi>Langeland,</hi> and <hi>Spro,</hi> and 3 more, to go and block up the paſſages of <hi>Nyburg,</hi> in Order to prevent the <hi>Swedes</hi> from putting any ſuccours into <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.</hi> In the mean while, a part of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Horſe had already begun to diſembark, and the next day, they all Landed.</p>
            <p>Some days before the deſcent, King <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> had entred the Iſle of <hi>Falſter,</hi> at the head of a Body of Horſe, to encourage his Troops by his preſence, and defend the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Iſles from the Irruption of the <hi>Danes;</hi> and before his departure, he ſeemed to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to be more inclinable to a Peace than before. But all thoſe fair appearances were but the pure effects of a diſſembling Policy that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:29562:116"/> him to make all thoſe advances, to gain time, and to prevent the mischiefs threatned him by the Junction of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets; ſo that he was extreamly ſurpriſed, when he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a little while after, that the two Fleets were already at Sea. Upon that news, he haſtned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with all ſpeed to <hi>Kotfoot,</hi> with a full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, to throw ſuccours into <hi>Funen,</hi> where he foreſaw, the Enemies deſigned to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent. But the Confederate Fleets having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his vigilance, he was much aſtoniſh'd to hear at his arrival, the Extraordinary noiſe of Cannon and ſmall Arms, which put him into ſuch a Tranſport of fury, that he Reſolved to go immediately in Perſon into <hi>Funen,</hi> to rouſe up the drooping courage of his men, and thereby prevent a blow that was likely to Ruine his faireſt hopes, and cut ſhort the ſwift Career of his Conqueſts. But his Council more wiſe and Conſiderate than he, diſſwaded him from it, by Repreſenting to him, to what great and inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble danger he would thereby expoſe himſelf, ſince there being no other way for him to paſs into <hi>Funen,</hi> but in a pitiful ſorry boat, in which he could hardly without a Miracle eſcape being taken by his Enemies. Having therefore chang'd his reſolution, he only ſent thither General <hi>Steen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bok,</hi> who arrived there time enough to be a Spectator of the misfortune of his Party, and to bear a ſhare in the total defeat of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> ſeeing Fortune begun to declare for them, reſolved, without any demurring, to puſh on their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes to the utmoſt, while Time was, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Winter, which would ſoon diſable their Fleets from ſtaying any longer at Sea. General <hi>Erneſt Albert de Eberſtein</hi> was arrived at the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Allies, ever ſince the 14th of the ſame Month, with a Reinforcement of 4 <hi>German</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

However, the <hi>Danes,</hi> put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves likewiſe in Order of Battle. General <hi>Eber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi> commanded the Right wing, Marſhal <hi>Tramp</hi> the left, and General <hi>Schak</hi> the Main Battle, where were placed the <hi>Dutch</hi> Colonels, <hi>Killigrew, Kuik, Meteren,</hi> and <hi>Ailua,</hi> with their Troops. The Fight was begun by the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Horſe; for <hi>Eberſtein</hi> and <hi>Schak</hi> fell with all the Vigour imaginable upon the Enemies, and broke through them, as far as the Hedges; but there they found ſo much Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Muſqueteers and Dragoons, that it was impoſſible for them to get any further: For the <hi>Swedes,</hi> adding Deſperation to their natural Bravery, not only repulſed their Enemies, but put them into ſuch diſorder, that both the Right and Left Wing of their Army began to give way; and further, they made themſelves Maſters of ſome of their Cannon; upon which <hi>Schak,</hi> having ſent Order to the <hi>Dutch</hi> to come up and charge, the Colonels, <hi>Killigrew, Meteren</hi> and <hi>Ailua,</hi> putting themſelves at the Head of them, led them up, charging them to keep cloſe together; the Right Wing of the <hi>Swedes</hi> did their utmoſt to break them, but the Pikes having repulſed them, they were forced, in a few Moments after, to quit their
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:29562:117"/> Poſt and their Cannon, and betake themſelves to Flight. The right Wing of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> having been thus driven out of the Field, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> fell upon the Left, which they likewiſe broke, ſo that the Victory, which ſeemed at firſt to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for the <hi>Swedes,</hi> then forſook them. Upon which, the <hi>Imperial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Prince of <hi>Sultsbach,</hi> and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Steenbok,</hi> ſeeing the Fortune of the Day loſt, being loth to coop themſelves up in <hi>Nyburg,</hi> fled through a Wood towards the Sea-coaſt; where, finding a Fiſher-boat, by vertue of large Offers of Mony, they perſuaded the Maſter of it to paſs them over the Night following into <hi>Zealand,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied only with two or three Servants.</p>

               </gap>o furiouſly into it, with all their Guns, that ſo many Houſes were beaten down by them, that the <hi>Swedish</hi> Horſe and other Soldiers that were retired thither, knew not where to fly for Shelter; and that ſmall Place was ſoon reduced to Aſhes, by the continual Broad-ſides that flew from the Navy, that ſwept away Men, Women and Horſes, and made the Air moſt dreadfully echo with the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:29562:117"/> Cries of an infinite number of wounded Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and the Deſolation was ſo great and ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, that very few Perſons could eſcape from it. The <hi>Swedes</hi> therefore, having loſt all Hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to defend the Place any longer, ſent a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter to the Generals <hi>Schak</hi> and <hi>Eberſtein,</hi> to let them know, They were ready to capitulate, and to deſire them to give order for the Cannon to ceaſe Firing. But they replied, They muſt expect no other Accommodation from them, but to ſurrender themſelves at Diſcretion. In the mean while, the Cannon played upon them without Intermiſſion, and a little while after, three <hi>Swedish</hi> Lords came out to the Camp, with Offers to yield at Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereupon, the Allies named the Sieurs <hi>Alefeld</hi> and <hi>Tromp</hi> to go on their part into the Town, to treat with the <hi>Swedish</hi> Generals, and a Trumpeter was ſent on board <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> to deſire him to intermit Firing, in regard the beſieged were treating to ſurrender at Diſcretion. <hi>De Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> anſwered, That they muſt reſolve to do it out of hand then, or elſe he would reduce the Town to a Heap of Rubbiſh. Thoſe Words were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a ſhort Ceſſation of Arms; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the beſieged made ſome Demur in coming to an Execution of all thoſe Offers, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> fired upon them again more fiercely than ever, till by a Letter from General <hi>Schak,</hi> he was informed, That the <hi>Swedes,</hi> had at laſt ſubmitted to the Clemency of the Victors, and that the Allies were infinitely obliged to him for having brought things in ſo ſhort a time, to ſo happy an Iſſue. Twelve Regiments of <hi>Swediſh</hi> Horſe, making in all 3000 Men, were made Priſoners of War on this occaſion. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of note, were 12 Colonels, and the Majors General <hi>Horn, Weyer</hi> and <hi>Waldeck;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Weymeren,</hi> and the Count <hi>Coningſmark,</hi> were taken Priſoners in the Battle. That Victory was ſo compleat, that there never was its parallel known, ſince of all the whole <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:29562:118"/> the Iſle of <hi>Funen,</hi> conſiſting of above 7000 Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, there eſcaped but two General Officers, and ſome few Private Soldiers, that ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Woods, when they were defeated. And beſides, it's worth remark, That thoſe Troops, ſo defeated, were the Braveſt, moſt Faithful, and moſt Veteran, and Diſciplined Soldiers of all the Forces of the King of <hi>Swedeland.</hi> On the <hi>Danes</hi> and Allies ſide, there were about 500 Men killed, among whom were reckoned 8 Officers of note, among whom was Captain <hi>Hemmema.</hi> The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> loſt very few, tho' they bore the greateſt brunt of the Battle. All thoſe happy Progreſſes were followed by the ſpeedy reduction of the greateſt of the <hi>Danish</hi> Iſles, except <hi>Zeeland,</hi> to that before oppreſſed Crown, and that in leſs than 16 Days. Near 100 Pieces of Cannon, and great ſtore of Ammunition were taken, and 120 Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards or Colours. About 2000 <hi>Swedes</hi> were kill'd, and 5000 made Priſoners. As for the Cavalry that were taken, they were part of them diſtributed among the <hi>Danish, Imperial</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Horſe. The Town of <hi>Nyburg</hi> was plundered by the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> kept ſtill under Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Funen</hi> being thus reduced under the Obedience of its rightful Prince, Vice-Admiral <hi>De Ruiter</hi> repreſented to General <hi>Schak,</hi> That it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Fleet to ſubſiſt any longer in thoſe parts, becauſe of the Dearneſs of Proviſions; adding, That the ſwift advance of the Winter obliged him likewiſe to retire. And, accordingly unmooring, on the 28th of <hi>November,</hi> he ſailed away to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> with a Fleet of 120 Sail, great and ſmall, to take in a Supply of Proviſions. The News of ſo many Advantages, gained by the Arms of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, was like a ſtroke of Thunder to King <hi>Guſtavus;</hi> for, after that Time, he gave himſelf ſo much to Melancholy, that he was never after ſeen in a good Humor: Nay, his Health was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:29562:118"/> endamaged thereby. He retired into the Caſtle of <hi>Knonenburg;</hi> where Reflecting upon the declining Condition of his Affairs, he judged there was no other way for him to take to retrieve them, than to reconcile himſelf with the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as the only Power that had broke his Deſigns, and interrupted the Courſe of his Conqueſts. And ſo earneſtly did he proſecute that expedient, that on the 9th of <hi>December,</hi> that is to ſay, fifteen Days after the Reduction of <hi>Nyburg,</hi> the Treaty of Alliance between <hi>Swedeland</hi> and the States was renewed, and ſigned by the Ambaſſadors of both Powers; which Treaty was followed with the Concluſion of the Project, formed before at <hi>Elbing</hi> with all its Dependencies; with this proviſional Condition, That the aboveſaid Treaty ſhould be of no Validity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhould not be put in execution till a Peace were firſt made and ratified between the two Crowns of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi> Such were the firſt Fruits of the Conqueſt of the Iſle of <hi>Funen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 1ſt of <hi>December, De Ruiter,</hi> having Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the States to winter in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> in order to take care to ſecure <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> came to an Anchor in the Road of <hi>Trave-Munde,</hi> from whence he ſailed next Day to <hi>Lubeck;</hi> where he took in Proviſions. On the 15th he ſteered away for <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen,</hi> where Admiral <hi>Bielk,</hi> coming on board him, preſented him with a Golden Chain and a Medal of great Value, from the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi> The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> having ſtill conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Forces in the Iſle of <hi>Zeeland,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> had ſome reaſon to fear ſome Irruption from them, when the Time of the Ice ſhould come; ſo that they reinforced the Garriſon of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a greater Number of Guns upon the Ramparts of the Town; and every Captain had his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Quarter aſſigned him, that they might be ready to oppoſe any Aſſaults from the <hi>Swedes;</hi> The Ice was broke for 40 Foot round every Man of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29562:119"/> War; and the <hi>Danes,</hi> in the mean time, making ſeveral Sallies againſt the Enemies, gained conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Advantages over them.</p>

               <note place="margin">1660.</note>This was the ſtate of the War in the North, when <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> at the beginning of the following Spring, having unmoored from <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> on the 3d of <hi>March,</hi> 1660. went and poſted himſelf, with his Fleet before the Haven of <hi>Landskroon,</hi> to block up its Paſſage, and hinder the coming out of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Fleet, which was then about 50 Sail ſtrong of Men of War. He had likewiſe at the ſame time detached from his Fleet a Squadron of 16 Men of War, to convoy home ſome Merchant-ſhips to <hi>Holland.</hi> Amidſt thoſe Tranſactions he heard the News of the Death of <hi>Charles Guſtavus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> which happened on the 23d of <hi>February</hi> at <hi>Gottenburg,</hi> a violent Diſtemper, of not above 6 Days continuance, having carried him off, in the 36th Year of his Age. The unexpected Death of that great Prince revived the Hopes and raiſed the palled Courage of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who, not without ſufficient Cauſe, looked on him as the Scourge of their Nation, by reaſon of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Valour and Succeſs.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Negotiation for a Peace, which the Plenipotentiaries of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But, However, at laſt, after many Obſtacles, it was happily concluded on the 6th of <hi>June.</hi> And four
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:29562:119"/> days after, the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army raiſed the Siege of <hi>Copenhagen;</hi> and the two Northern Crowns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by put an end to thoſe Troubles that ſeemed to have rendred them irreconcilable, and that had kindled the Jealouſie, and raiſed the Arms of ſo many Princes againſt the growing Power of <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

            <p>The States ſeeing Affairs were happily terminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that ſide, ſent Orders to <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> that as ſoon as the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſhould have reſtored to <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> all the Places they were obliged to reſtore by the Treaty, he ſhould re-imbark the States Troops, and return back with his Navy to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> conſidering the great Service he had received from <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> not willing to let him depart, without giving him ſome Marks of his Acknowledgment, would needs honour him with the Order of Knighthood, for him and his heirs, and with Letters of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, to which he added an annual Penſion of 800 Crowns. <hi>Pulchler</hi> likewiſe who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Land Forces, was gratified with an annual Penſion, a Golden Chain, and a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.

            <p>In the mean time, the Corſairs of <hi>Barbary</hi> did ſo much miſchief in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1662"/> that the States were forced to ſend thither Vice-Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> with a Fleet of about 20 men of War.

But inſtead of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pacifie the turbulent humour of thoſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians;</hi> the <hi>Algerine</hi> grew thereupon the more inſolent. For becauſe the Ratification of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not preſently ſent them, and that ſeveral months had paſt, without their ſeeing either any one Dutch Man of War, or the promiſed ranſome for the Slaves of that Nation, they began to grow ſo much the more impatient, becauſe the Plague that then raged among them, ſweeping away many of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Slaves, deprived thereby their greedy Patrons of their Ranſom too; So that the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of thoſe diſcontented <hi>Barbarians,</hi> ſoon after broke out in new Hoſtilities. For at the beginning of the Summer, they took upon them to viſit the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant Ships, and then under pretence they were laden with Merchandiſes belonging to their Enemies, they pillaged them without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. And not long after they carried a Dutch Merchant Ship to <hi>Algiers,</hi> confiſcated her Cargo, and ſold her Men for Slaves. The States hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all theſe miſchiefs Writ to their Conſul there, <hi>Vanden Burg,</hi> to ſollicit the Reſtitution of the Effects that were ſeiz'd, and the Liberty of the Slaves thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> had newly made; But the <hi>Corſairs</hi> refuſing to give any ſatisfaction, the States gave Orders, they ſhould be obliged to it by force of Arms.</p>
            <p>Rear-Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> therefore having begun to give them Chace, took ſeveral of them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1664"/> and freed thereby a great number of <hi>Chriſtian Slaves.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, he took two <hi>Algerine Corſairs</hi> on the 10th of <hi>January,</hi> near <hi>Malaga,</hi> whereof one carried 18, and the other 20 Guns, and had on board her 180 <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Moors,</hi> 25 <hi>Chriſtian Slaves,</hi> and 5 Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadoes. Theſe Priſes cauſed great alarms at <hi>Algeirs,</hi> where the <hi>Barbarians</hi> gave out, that their loſſes in them amounted to the number of 6 or 700 <hi>Turks, Moors</hi> or <hi>Renegadoes,</hi> for which they demanded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:29562:121"/> of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Conſul. Offering to make ſatisfaction for their own Hoſtilities; to Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh all things again upon a good Foot, and to break the Treaty Concluded with the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> They promiſed likewiſe, they would ſtay for the Money deſigned for the Ranſoming of the Dutch Slaves, and demanded earneſt for it, thinking it was not yet too late to obtain, a Ratification of the laſt Treaty of Peace. But the States being but too well acquainted with the Perfidiouſneſs, and Inconſtancy of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> were ſo far from hearkning to them, that they ſollicited the Kings of <hi>France, Spain</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to joyn their Forces with thoſe of the United Provinces, to Deſtroy them; ſince they exerciſed their Piracies no leſs upon the Subjects of thoſe Crowns, than upon thoſe of the United Provinces. And the States would fain have perſwaded thoſe Powers to have ſet out three ſeveral Fleets, under the Flagg of each Nation, to go and Beſiege their Harbours, Chace them from the Sea, and utterly ruine their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and inſupportable Domination, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any regard to any former Treaty of Peace or Alliance. Which Project ſeemed very important and well contrived: But yet not one of thoſe three Princes could be perſwaded to hearken to it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King indeed highly praiſed it, and gave leave to the Dutch to erect Magazines for that effect, both of Proviſions and Ammunition, at <hi>Thoulon,</hi> or <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> gave Order, that the Dutch Men of War might have free Ingreſs and Egreſs in and out of his Ports: And the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> reſolved to ſend a Fleet into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> but it was more, to give new Umbrages than to correſpond with the deſign of the States, and many already could ſee in the ſhuffling conduct of that Prince, certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of an approaching Rupture of the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the United Provinces. For at the ſame time that he propoſed to ſend a Fleet into the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:29562:121"/> 
               <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> to act in concert with that of the States, he had on the other ſide given private order to Captain <hi>Holms</hi> to ſail to the Court of <hi>Africa</hi> to ruin there the Commerce of the Dutch <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Company, and to ſeze their ſhips and Forts. The States therefore ſeeing there was little Reliance to be made upon the aſſiſtance of any of all thoſe Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regin Powers, in order to free the Sea from the intolerable Robberies of the <hi>Algerines,</hi> Reſolved to concern themſelves no further than for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their own Subjects, by ſending ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fleet into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> becauſe Rear-Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> had not ſufficient Forces to accompliſh ſo great an Enterpriſe. That Fleet was compoſed of 12 Ships of War, and one Flute laden with Proviſions.</p>
            <p>They put to Sea about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and on the 19th of <hi>June,</hi> arrived in the Road of <hi>Algiers. De Ruiter</hi> preſently ſent notice of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival to the <hi>Divan,</hi> to remind them to pay him the uſual Honours, and to Congratulate his arrival. But they were ſo far from acquitting themſelves of the Duty he pretended from them, that they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let the Dutch Conſul come on board to ſpeak with the Vice-Admiral, and to ſend Hoſtages for the ſecurity of the Credential Letters, which were to be preſented to the <hi>Divan</hi> from the States; for all they would do, was only to Grant a Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port by vertue of which the Commiſſioners, <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> and <hi>Reyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld de Koeverden</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town: who in the firſt Audience they had, demand the exchange of Priſoners, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of the <hi>Chriſtian Slaves</hi> at the rate they were firſt ſold for, according to the Conditions of the laſt Treaty of Peace, adding that as for other differences, they ſhould be adjuſted by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to be appointed for that purpoſe on each ſide. All which was refuſed by the <hi>Divan,</hi> who pretended, before they entered into any Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the Releaſe of Priſoners, to know
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:29562:122"/> upon what grounds they might be aſſured of a Peace. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> upon that, ſent them a Memorial that made a great noiſe amongſt thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> becauſe they would by no means conſent to any indemnification, nor to the Condition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon by the <hi>Dutch</hi> that no free Ship ſhould be liable to be viſited, which was the Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> So that that point was hotly diſputed on both ſides in the <hi>Divan;</hi> But after all, the <hi>Algerines</hi> were obſtinate, and would abſolutely reſerve themſelves a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to viſit all <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, and to declare for Lawful Prize all the effects they found in them to belong to other Nations. In fine, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Negotiation was this, That thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> declared to <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> that if he would not accept their propoſitions, he would not permit the <hi>Dutch</hi> Conſul to retire on board him, till he had before hand ſent on ſhore 37 <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Moors</hi> that were Priſoners in his Fleet. Which demand of theirs he thought fit to grant, to prevent the miſchiefs that might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe happen to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Conſul and his Retinue, of which he had a freſh Example in the Perſon of the <hi>English</hi> Conſul whom thoſe Pyrates had cruelly handled, after they had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Peace with <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>De Ruiter</hi> therefore plainly finding, that it was to no purpoſe to uſe any gentle methods with them, Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The next day, the Fleet unmoored, and went and Anchored on the 7th of the ſame Month at <hi>Alicant,</hi> where <hi>de Ruiter</hi> Received a Letter with advice of the new Troubles that Threatned the United Provinces from the <hi>English</hi> and with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to him, to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the mean while, Mr. <hi>de Goch</hi> ſet out the 17th of <hi>June,</hi> in Quality of Ambaſſadour from the States, towards the Court of <hi>England,</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour amicably to appeaſe and compoſe the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that threatned the two Nations with a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He arrived on the 22d at <hi>London,</hi> and was received by the Maſter of the Ceremonies, with great Marks of Friendſhip, and the very ſame Evening had Audience of his Majeſty at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall;</hi> and after the uſual Compliments, their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe fell upon the Affairs that concerned the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Companies, upon which the King, among other Reaſons, told him, <q>That it was not to be ſuffered, That the <hi>DutchWeſt-India</hi> Company only by the means of a few Forts, and 3 or 4 Ships, without poſſeſſing elſewhere any Country within Land, ſhould pretend to render the Coaſts of <hi>Africk</hi> inacceſſible to all others, by blocking up the Havens and the Mouths of the Rivers, againſt their Commerce, and keeping
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:29562:127"/> them off, and driving them away from every Place. The Ambaſſadour replied, 'That all the Difficulties about that Affair were terminated by the laſt Treaty; and that it ought to be examined whether the <hi>Dutch</hi> had done any thing in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to it.</q> After that he made his Complaints of the Hoſtile Attempts of Captain <hi>Holms,</hi> in <hi>Guiney:</hi> 
               <q>To which the King made him the ſame Anſwer he had done before upon the like Subject, That he had not the leaſt Knowledge of that, but that as ſoon as he ſhould be informed of it, he would act as he found convenient.</q> After which he begun to ſpeak of the great Naval Preparations that were making in <hi>Holland.</hi> The States Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour juſtified himſelf, by anſwering, <q>That thoſe Preparations were chiefly for the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys they were forced to allow their Merchant Ships, for the Security of their Commerce;</q> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majeſty withal, <q>That he would pleaſe to give order, as the States would likewiſe do, on their ſide, that nothing might paſs between the two Fleets, that might diſturb the Peace, or ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate the good Correſpondence ſettled between the two Nations.</q> The next day Mr. <hi>de Goch,</hi> had Audience of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and in the Evening of the Chancellour; in which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of nothing elſe but of the great Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for War, and of the Affairs of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Companies. Some Time after, the States Ambaſſadour preſented a Memorial concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extraordinary Naval Preparations in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and about the Hoſtilities committed by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Holms,</hi> and the forbidding of the Importation of <hi>Dutch</hi> Commodities into the Kingdom, under the Pretence of the contagious Diſeaſe that then reigned in <hi>Holland.</hi> The King anſwered very largely to all thoſe Points, in Writing; of which the Subſtance was, <q rend="inline">That he had no Deſign his Fleet ſhould commit any Act of Hoſtility; That he had given no Order to Captain <hi>Holms</hi> to ſeiſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:29562:128"/> upon <hi>Cape-Verde,</hi> or any other Forts belonging to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> nor to attempt any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Subjects of the United Provinces; That they ought to have more confidence in his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al word, than in the Reports of Pilots and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, who were very often ill informed: That as what concerned his forbidding the importation of Dutch Commodities, upon the account of the Contagion, he was obliged ſo to do, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Kingdom, and of the health of his Subjects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while the <hi>French</hi> King by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors at <hi>London</hi> and the <hi>Hague,</hi> preſented his Mediation in order to appeaſe the differences that were ready to kindle a War between thoſe two Powers; which the United Provinces agreeably received, but <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngland</hi> refuſed: Which was the cauſe, that a little time after the Ambaſſadors of that Crown returned home very ill ſatisfied. The States laying nothing more to Heart, than the maintenance of Peace, and being very ſenſible how dear the laſt War had coſt them, were glad before they engaged themſelves in ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to try all means poſſible to avert it. For that effect, they writ a Letter to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to ſignifie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o him, that they had no other Paſſion greater than that to preſerve Peace, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majeſty would be of the ſame mind. The King made anſwer to the States by another Letter, which was delivered them by the Engliſh Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador at his return to the <hi>Hague,</hi> for he had made a ſtep to <hi>London,</hi> to endeavour to terminate the differences between the two Companies of the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies.</hi> That Letter was full of proteſtations, ſignifying the great deſire the King had on his ſide, to maintain the Peace; But then returning to the accuſtomed complaints, it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he ſaw with great regret, that they went not about to give any ſatisfaction to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for their loſſes; and in fine, concluded with
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:29562:128"/> a proteſtation before God and Man, that they would be guilty of all the Inconveniencies, and fatal Conſequences that would follow, if a ſpeedy Reparation were not made.</p>
            <p>The States, after the reading of that Letter, found well enough, that they were no longer to flatter themſelves, the Intention of the Court of <hi>England</hi> being there clearly enough laid open to them, and without mincing of the matter, the King foretold them a part of thoſe diſaſters that were ready to happen. In the mean while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navy was aſſembling with all diligence in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and about the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> And ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Advice-Yachts that were ſent out from time to time, to view and obſerve them were ſeized: Which confirmed the States in the Reſolution to have Recourſe to nothing elſe but the force of Arms.</p>
            <p>Rear-Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> being at Sea, as we have ſaid, to Cruiſe upon the Watch for the Ships that were expected from the Eaſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> had met them in the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at <hi>Fairhills</hi> near <hi>Hitland,</hi> and had conducted them into their reſpective Ports, without ſeeing any Engliſh by the way. And four Merchant Ships belonging to the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Bound for the Coaſt of <hi>Guiney</hi> were ready to ſet ſail; but it was not thought fit to let them go without a good Convoy, becauſe of the advice they had had, that Prince <hi>Robert</hi> with a Squadron of 18 Men of War, was ready to ſet out for <hi>Guiney,</hi> whither he was going to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the depredations the Engliſh were making in thoſe parts. The States in regard of the Good Services they had received from the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company in ſeveral occaſions, were reſolved to employ their Forces to protect them: And for that end gave order to Captain <hi>Kampen</hi> with a Squadron of 10 Men of War, to Convoy to <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> the 4 Ships bound thither belonging to that Company. But becauſe they doubted not but that the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> would conſtrue
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:29562:129"/> that Reſolution for a new attempt on their ſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Breach of a Peace, they ſent orders to their Ambaſſador at <hi>London</hi> to preſent his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty the following Memorial thereupon.</p>

               </note>THE States General of the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces having had advice from their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador at <hi>London,</hi> by their laſt Letters from him, That the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and his Majeſties chief Miniſters of State, had teſtified ſome diſcontent at their arming out ſome Ships of War deſigned for the Coaſt of <hi>Guiney,</hi> have thought fit for the taking away of all ſort of Umbrage to declare the Reaſons that moved them to that extraordinary Arming. Which are, That the States of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces having heard with much regret, That ſome Nation among which were ſome Subjects of his Majeſty, contrary to his approbation, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Proteſtations that he had given no order for it, had ſome time ſince, by ſome hoſtilities attempted upon the Liberty of the Good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the State, and eſpecially thoſe in their Countries in <hi>Africk,</hi> belonging to the Weſt-<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> Company, and principally upon the Coaſts of <hi>Guiney,</hi> in ſeizing upon their Ships and Effects, and attacking in the boſome of Peace, this State, by taking of the Forts and Places it poſſeſſes: The United Provinces judging it their Duty to Protect their Good Subjects in thoſe Countries, as far as it ſhould be in their Power, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them for the future from the like attempts, had reſolved to ſend thither a Squadron of 10 Men of War, and ſo much the rather becauſe the Weſt-<hi>India</hi> Company is about ſending thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther four Merchant Ships richly laden, which it was not thought fit to expoſe without a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to the danger the others have incurred, knowing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The States being glad to uſe all imaginable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions to prevent any attempts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt thoſe Ships, becauſe they knew well enough from good hands, that the Engliſh-Fleet was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to put to Sea, gave order to Lieutenant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Opdam,</hi> who was then at <hi>Goree</hi> with a part of the States Fleet, to Convoy them the length of the Channel.

The directors of the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany made their Complaints of it, to their High and Mightineſſes, hoping they might come to an amicable Accommodation about it, but the reſult made it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> plainly appear, that the <hi>English</hi> intended nothing leſs than Peace.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the King of great <hi>Britain</hi> had Advice from Vice Admiral <hi>Lawſon,</hi> and Captain <hi>Berkley</hi> at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> that Vice Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> having Anchored in the Road of that Town, had taken in Proviſions for a year, and that on the 5th. of <hi>October</hi> at 8 in the morning he weighed Anchor, with a Squadron of 12 great Men of War, in order to make the beſt of his way in all appearance towards the Coaſts of <hi>Guiney,</hi> tho' he had given out that he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Sally.</hi> And indeed the ſuſpicions of the <hi>English</hi> in that point were not without ſome foundation, for <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had received Expreſs Orders from the States, to ſail towards <hi>Cape Verd</hi> and the Coaſt of <hi>Guiney;</hi> to reduce the <hi>English</hi> to reaſon, and make them reſtore by force what they had unjuſtly uſurpt.</p>
            <pb n="254" facs="tcp:29562:133"/>
            <p>Upon that news all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships were ſtopt in <hi>England,</hi> and Letters of repriſal were granted; but all thoſe Commiſſions granted in haſte were recalled, as well to ſhew all <hi>Europe,</hi> that they would not be Aggreſſors, as to gain time to Compleat the manning of their Navy. It was thought more proper to let looſe the men of War and Capers upon the <hi>Hollanders</hi> as well to encourage their preſs'd Seamen, and to get men enough to furniſh their Grand Fleet, as the more effectually to interrupt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the United Provinces, by taking their Merchant Ships that went to and fro in the Channel.</p>
            <p>And becauſe they knew, they in <hi>Holland</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected about that time the return of their Ships from <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Streights,</hi> they thought it their beſt way to go and meet them, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to take them, before they let the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers go out, who in all likelihood, would but have awakened the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and made them think the more of ſecuring themſelves. And this project ſucceeded well with them: For the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Fleet conſiſting of 113 ſail, having quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> to purſue their way home along the Channel, was taken, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Ports of <hi>England.</hi> But amongſt ſo great a Number of Merchant Ships, there being ſome Ships belonging to other Nations, they were redemanded, yet all the reſt remained in their hands. At the ſame time the King of <hi>England</hi> in Juſtification of that proceeding, publiſh'd the following Declaration</p>

They likewiſe rigorouſly prohibited the going out of any veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and exportation of any Ammunitions, and generally of all materials ſerving to the building of Men of War, or furniſhing their Equipages.

They reſolved likewiſe to raiſe a fund of 14 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Livers, as well for the building of 48 men of War, as for Levying of ſome Troops, to Re-inforce their Companies and their Garriſons, for the raiſing of a Marine Regiment, and a new Regiment in reſerve, and laſtly, for defraying the expences of the fortifications of the <hi>Brill,</hi> of <hi>Helvoet,</hi> of <hi>Maeſland,</hi> of the <hi>Texel,</hi> and of the other neceſſities of the State.

            <p>And the Court of <hi>England</hi> was juſt ready to put out a Declaration of War againſt the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers;</hi> But that <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Walker</hi> two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Advocates of the Court of Admiralty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the King, that if he declared War at that time, the Ships taken before the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, could not according to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be confiſcated, upon which, 'twas thought fit to defer it for ſome time. However the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships were declared Good Prize on the 6th. of <hi>January</hi> 1665. But when they came to the ſale of them, the Commiſſioners of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty were far from finding their account advanced by it, ſo little money did they receive from it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe beſides that all the beſt of what was in thoſe Ships, had been imbezell'd, the charges of the Admiralty Court amounted to very conſiderable ſums.</p>

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:29562:135"/> we had reaſon to hope for if we had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded; for without difficulty with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Protection, the <hi>English</hi> would have been beaten, whereas on the contrary to our great regret, Commadore <hi>Brakel</hi> was kill'd, as alſo two others, and ſome wounded in his Ship which has received ſome ſhot under Water, and we are now buſie in repairing her. Captain <hi>Roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening</hi> has likewiſe had 2 men kill'd, and ſome wounded. As for my ſelf, God be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I have received no damage excepting ſome ſhot in my ſails, and ſome of my Rigging ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. The <hi>English</hi> have taken 2 ſmall Ships. The Pilot <hi>John Roelofsz</hi> who was in the Ship <hi>King Solomon,</hi> was ſunk after he had defended himſelf like a brave Soldier: The Ship St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> one of thoſe we loſt in the Night, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>English</hi> before the fight, as ſhe was retiring into the Road, where we arrived in the dusk of the Evening.

For to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, there was an Ordinance publiſh'd, dated the 10th. of <hi>March,</hi> by which it was promiſed, That whatſoever ſhip of the States ſhould in a General Sea-fight between the two Fleets or in any Rencounter, take any <hi>English</hi> ſhip, ſhould have not only the ſhip ſo taken, with all that belonged to it as a reward, but that over and above that, he that ſhould take the chief Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral ſhip of the <hi>English</hi> ſhould have 50000 Livers Gratification;, for every other Admiral ſhip, 30000 Livers; for every ſhip of other General Officers, 20000 Livers; for every other ſhip of War carrying 40 Guns, 10000, and for every other ſhip leſs conſiderable, excepting Yachts, 6000 Livers: That he that ſhould bring away the Flag of the chief Admiral ſhould have 5000 Livers Reward, and for the Flags of the other Admirals, 2500 Livers; for the Flag of a fore maſt, 1250 Livers; for that of the mizzen maſt, 750 Livers and for the Flag on the Poop 250 Livers. The Captains of the Fire-Ships that ſhould burn any of the Enemies Ships, were to have for each of them ſo burnt the 3d. part of the Sum promiſed to thoſe who take an <hi>English</hi> man of War. The ſame reward was Aſſigned for thoſe who in quality of Volunteers, ſhould ſet out Fire-Ships for the Service of the State. He that could ſink or otherwiſe deſtroy any of the Enemies Fire ſhips that were ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage any of the States men of War, was to have 6000 Livers Gratification, Thoſe who out of an Extraordinary affection to their Country
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:29562:137"/> ſhould furniſh out any man of War to join the Flag of the States Fleet, to endeavour the ruine of the Common Enemy, were to receive double the reward granted to the other ſhips of the State, both for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhips they ſhould take and for their Flags, and that in acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Zeal, their Fidelity, and their Bravery, There were alſo particular Recompences allotted to thoſe that ſhould reſcue out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any of the States Men of War that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be ſurrounded by the Enemies, and ready to be burnt or ſunk, and to thoſe who out of a General fight, ſhould take any <hi>Engliſh</hi> man of War. Beſides all which, there was granted to the Widows and Children of thoſe that ſhould happen to be killed in the fight, double the ſum of their Huſbands or Parents Wages; It was likewiſe Ordered, that the ſaid Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences ſhould be granted, tho' the ſhips that had merited them ſhou'd happen to be ſunk, or that they could not be brought back into their Ports. And to ſecond, and raiſe the Courage of the Great Men, and inſpire honour into the Cowards and run-aways, it was decreed, that thoſe who ſhould deliver up any of the States men of War into the hands of the <hi>English</hi> ſhould be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in a Council of War, and puniſh'd with death, without diſtinction, and without remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that all Sea-Officers whether General or Subaltern, who ſhould quit the Flag without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs order from the Admiral, ſhould alſo be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A little while after, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Ordinance came out from the States, bearing date the 17th. of <hi>March,</hi> allotting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences for thoſe who ſhould be diſabled, or maimed in the Service of the States, after the following rates, <hi>viz.</hi>

The Wind being eaſterly, the <hi>English</hi> kept, during the Night before <hi>Alborough,</hi> at about 5 Miles diſtance from the Shore; about Midnight the Duke of <hi>York</hi> received Advice, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, ſteering towards the South-eaſt, was making directly up to him, and was not above 6 Miles from him; upon which News, the <hi>English</hi> made all their loaden Ships retire towards the Shore; and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> on their ſide endeavoured to get the Weather-gage. The 12th of the ſame Month, the Wind being at Eaſt, the <hi>Dutch</hi> were at about 5 Miles Diſtance from the <hi>English</hi> to the South-eaſtward, and then the Wind, turning to the South-weſt, continued ſo all Night, and the two Fleets met before <hi>Layſtoff,</hi> at about 8 Miles diſtance from the <hi>English</hi> Shore. That Night, a <hi>Dutch</hi> Fire-ſhip took Fire, by the Imprudence of him that commanded it, who was got drunk; which Accident the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took for a happy Preſage of Victory to them. However, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, in
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:29562:141"/> ſpite of the Diſadvantage of the Wind, of which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were Maſters, during the whole Fight, fell upon Prince <hi>Robert</hi>'s Squadron that was backt by Vice-Admiral <hi>Mings.</hi> The Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Squadron formed the main Battle, and that of the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> made up the Rear. The Battle begun at 3 in the Morning. Admiral <hi>Opdam</hi> vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly broke through Prince <hi>Robert</hi>'s Squadron, being followed by Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Kortenaar,</hi> Lieutenant Admiral <hi>John Evertſz,</hi> Vice-Admiral <hi>Cornelius Tromp, Stellingwerf, Baſtian, Senten,</hi> &amp;c. The two Fleets engaged in ſtreight Lines, without throwing themſelves into <hi>Creſcents,</hi> and ſo recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally broke through one another, remaining ſtill in Preſence one of the other, without rallying preſently to make a freſh Charge. The Wind was Weſt, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were towards the North-weſt, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> to the South-weſtward; the two Fleets broke through one another the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, at 6 in the Morning. And becauſe the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Squadron kept ſtill the Weather-gage, without engaging in Fight, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to win that Advantage from them; but it fared not in the like manner with that of Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> which was broken through by the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> But the two Fleets having till then done nothing but canonaded one another afar off, at length the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> advancing, about one in the Afternoon, ſeparated the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet in two; and then the two Fleets coming to a cloſer Fight, and firing at one another very fiercely, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Opdam</hi> boarded the <hi>Royal Charles,</hi> in which was the Duke of <hi>York</hi> in Perſon; and thoſe two Admirals thundred at one another ſo furiouſly, with continual Broad-ſides, that the Earl of <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Muskerry,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and ſome of that Princes Footmen, were killed by the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Side, and he himſelf was ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded in the Hand, which was dyed with the Blood of Mr. <hi>Boyle;</hi> and juſt then, as they were

The <hi>Nagelboom</hi> being come to an Anchor before <hi>Petten,</hi> the Captain would not deſert her, tho' ſhe were left dry; but the Seamen running all away, wandred begging along the Coaſt like ſo many Raſcals as they were, ſo that the <hi>English</hi> coming up, took her, as they did ſeveral other very fine Ships, that were loſt to the State, by the meer Cowardice of the Seamen. The Maſter of <hi>Kortenaar</hi>'s Ship, <hi>Ate Inter Inſtra,</hi> inſtead of ſtaying in the Fight, baſely deſerted it, and was followed by a great many others, which yet, when they were come into the <hi>Texel,</hi> had the Confidence to complain, That they had been ſo much expoſed, when they ſcarce had had the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to take any more than a Glympſe of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

            <p>The Winning of this Battle ought not to be imputed to the Bravery of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſince the greateſt part of the ſhips they took in it, were delivered them by the Rebellion or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice of the Seamen, who received in <hi>England</hi> the juſt reward of their infidelity by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries they were made to ſuffer there in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The Action of 85 Villains that ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the ſhip <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. is a terrible and abominable Example of it. They were ſome Soldiers who in the night of the Battle, joining with ſome inſolent and ſeditious Seamen ſeized of all the ſmall fire Arms, nailed up the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:29562:144"/> Cannon, ſtruck their Flag, ſpread their Sails, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Barges and long Boats a drift to the mercy of the Waves, and in that condition wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the approach of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fregat that was in chace of them, to which they Voluntarily yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves, after they had with their drawn hangers and cockt piſtols preſented to their breaſts forced the Captain and Officers that belonged to the ſhip, who would have oppoſed them, to remain in ſilence, under pain of death, and to be ſpectators of ſo deteſtable an Action without during to ſpeak a word. The men of the ſhips <hi>Helverſum</hi> and <hi>Nagelboom,</hi> as alſo ſome Officers of the Fleet, of whom we ſhall ſpeak more amply afterwards, did the like without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any regard neither to their honour, nor to the allegiance they had ſo ſolemnly ſworn to their Country.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (as the <hi>Dutch</hi> would have been in the ſame caſe, and as they affected to do afterwards, upon leſs occaſions of Bragging than this,) being proud of all theſe advantages, failed not to publiſh them with all the glorious Circumſtances imaginable. They Rung the Bells and made Bonfires every where, and put every thing elſe in practice that might tend to add ſplendor and renown to the Memory of ſo great a Triumph. 1500 <hi>Dutch</hi> Priſoners were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Colchester;</hi> and it may well be judged by ſo great a Number what cruel and baſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice the Captains were guilty of, who choſe rather ſhamefully to leave their Companions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Flames, or to a Lamentable ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack and drowning, than to venture to ſnatch them from the devouring Jaws of death, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them on board them when they fled, ſo that they muſt have periſh'd, if their Enemies had not taken more Compaſſion of them then their own unnatural Officers. Amongſt thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there was a Woman named <hi>Willemite Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:29562:145"/> a Native of <hi>Embden,</hi> that had performed the function of Gunner in the ſhip <hi>Marſſeveen,</hi> who being diſcovered, was releaſed and ſet at liberty by King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond for the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the adventure.

            <p>Before we paſs, any further, we will report here ſome remarkable Circumſtances relating to this fight.</p>
            <p>The States after the Battle, being willing to provide againſt all Events had ſent Orders to the Fleet to keep the Sea, tho' they had had the worſt, as well to ſupport the Reputation of their Arms, as to leſſen the Glory of the Victors, that would have made that retreat paſs for a total defeat. And for that effect, Mr. <hi>Witſen, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rybergen,</hi> and <hi>Schrick</hi> being ſent to the <hi>Texel,</hi> in Quality of Deputies from the States, went out of the Port, and ſent for Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Tromp</hi> on board them giving him Order to keep the Fleet out at Sea, and not to ſuffer it to enter into any Harbours. But <hi>Tromp</hi> being griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the diſaſters that had newly hapned by the Baſeneſs and Cowardice of the Officers and Soldiers of the Fleet, and his heart being ready to burſt with indignation at them, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Anſwering, the Deputies that he could not execute their orders with men that had ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerted him in time of danger, and upon whoſe Courage or Fidelity ſo little reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance could be made. So that without minding the Orders of the Deputies, the Fleet under the Conduct of <hi>Tromp</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Evertſz</hi> entred into port, being in all about 60 Men of War, of which the moſt part were but little endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Admiral <hi>Waſſenaar,</hi> or <hi>Opdam</hi>'s ſhip, was,
<pb facs="tcp:29562:146"/> as we have ſaid, blown up; <hi>Kortenaar</hi>

               </gap> the States Deputies took a review of the ſhips remaining in the <hi>Texel,</hi> found all of them in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral very little endamaged, and the moſt part in good condition, having loſt very few Men, and in a Word, more afraid than hurt. The ſhips that were ſtill in the <hi>Texel</hi> were 58 in Number, 7 that had ſtaid behind in the Road and 2 unmoor'd that were put in before. They had advice that 18 were in the Port of the <hi>Vlie,</hi> and 16 or 17 in the <hi>Meuſe, &amp;c.</hi> So that they found none were miſſing but thoſe we have ſet down, of all the whole Fleet.</p>
            <p>In the mean while however, the murmurings of the People that were ill ſatisfied at the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Battle and the Conduct of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, were grown to an extream height, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun to threaten miſchievous Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The firſt ſparks of them begun to appear at the <hi>Brill,</hi> where <hi>John Evertſz</hi> of <hi>Zealand</hi> had like to have loſt his life. For being come with his Ship into the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and Landing at the <hi>Brill,</hi> at his arrival the <hi>Mobb</hi> that judge of things always by the ſucceſs, laid all the blame upon him, and imputing to him a great part of all the misfortunes that had hapned and accuſing him of Cowardice, threw him into the Water, where he would certainly have been drown'd if he had not been reſcued from the People by a good Number of Soldiers. But they ſtopt not there, for that Raſcality growing thereupon more inſolent endeavoured, all they could to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their unruly paſſion, and puſht on their reſentments to the utmoſt; ſo that in the night there appeared a great many Boats filled with Troops of Mutineers and Women, paſſing the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to go and watch his coming to <hi>Maaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landſluis,</hi>

            <p>This Council of War then having drawn up an Indictment againſt thoſe Officers of the Fleet that firſt begun to flie, as Authors of the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and of the defeat of the Fleet they were condemned, and accordingly the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>John Peiterſz Onklaar, Anthony Evertſz, De Marre</hi> and <hi>Jacob Bruining</hi> were ſhot on the 13th. of <hi>June</hi> in the Fort of the <hi>Texel,</hi> in view of all the people, and on the ſame day and in the ſame place, the Captains <hi>VVilliam Codde, Vander Burg, John Vander Mariche</hi> and <hi>Apollonius Pool</hi> had their Arms broken at their Feet by the Common Hang-Man; and <hi>Samuel Huiſman</hi> and <hi>Jacob Vander Kams</hi> were degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the firſt of them made uncapable of

And accordingly Captain <hi>De Haan</hi> that had fought ſo bravely, and taken the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship called the <hi>Charity,</hi> received 10000 Livers reward.

His advancement to that Office, rekindled a freſh the before damped zeal of the Seamen who teſtified an extraordinary joy at it, by reaſon of the extreme affection they bore him, which equall'd that they always had for his Father.</p>
            <pb n="287" facs="tcp:29562:150"/>
            <p>In the mean while, the States being intent upon conſulting the means how to repair the ill ſucceſs of their Arms, by new Forces, gave orders for working with all poſſible diligence in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces near the Sea, to fit up the Fleet again, and put it in a good Condition, and that ſo much the more preſtingly, becauſe they knew the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Fleet was cruſing in the Channel, to watch for <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s return, which was daily expected. After the Death of Mr. <hi>Opdam,</hi> they were much puzled about the choice of a perſon fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the chief Command of their Fleet. Many of them caſt their Eyes upon Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> but the obſtinacy he had ſhewn againſt the Orders of the Deputies, when inſtead of keeping the Fleet out at Sea after the defeat, as they had Commanded, he made it go into the <hi>Texel,</hi> gave grounds for ſome miſunderſtanding, and cauſed a great many murmurings to ariſe, to the diſadvantage of his reputation. Yet on the other ſide, they put great confidence in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage, and in the ſingular affection the Seamen had for him; but thoſe good thoughts were again over balanced by the ſuſpicions ſome predominant Members of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> then ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But however, the moſt judicious among them conteſted againſt all thoſe ſeeming ſpecious reaſons, with more ſolid proofs drawn from his incomparable great Worth and Merit, not ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſay without bogling, that they could not well chuſe another to that high Preferment without doing him injuſtice. At length after many debates
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:29562:151"/> and contrary Opinions thereupon, they reſolved by common conſent to confer upon him that great Employment,<note place="margin">

She proved to be an <hi>English</hi> ſhip of 20 Guns, and 40 Men, call'd the St. <hi>Martha;</hi> which after we had unladen, we converted into a Fire-ſhip for the Service of the Fleet upon occaſion. In that place we ſeparated our ſelves for ſome days, as well to go and take in freſh Water, as to unlade our ſhips. On the 10th. we received Letters from the States, with orders to deſtroy all the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> ſhips we could find on the Coaſts of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> and of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> On the 6th. of <hi>February,</hi> we weighed Anchor, and ſet ſail toward <hi>Cormantine,</hi> poſſeſſed by the <hi>English,</hi> and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome miles from the Caſtle <hi>del Mina.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noon, we paſt by a place belonging to the <hi>English</hi> called <hi>Cabo Corſo,</hi> and near a <hi>Danish</hi> Caſtle, as far a as place called then <hi>Morea,</hi> but formerly <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> of which the <hi>Dutch</hi> are in poſſeſſion, whither after <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had ſent a Letter, we continued our Courſe, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſt by the Fort <hi>Anamabo,</hi> and towards evening came to an Anchor between <hi>Adia</hi> and <hi>Cormantine</hi> which are two places poſſeſt by the <hi>English.</hi> There we found an <hi>English</hi> Ship which upon ſight of us, made towards the ſhore, and

Upon which all our long Boats and Barges were manned out with Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Seamen, and Scaling Ladders were prepared for an Aſſault. Captain <hi>Vander Zaan</hi> Commanded the Seamen and Count <hi>Hoorn,</hi> the Soldiers. And ſo they Landed their Men in good order, to attack the Caſtle of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine.</hi> As ſoon as we were Landed the <hi>English</hi> blew up the Caſtle of <hi>Anamabo,</hi> which encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged us extreamly; But alas, thoſe happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginings had not the ſame ſucceſſes afterwards; For at our approach to <hi>Adia,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Negroes</hi> on the other, that in great Numbers appeared on the Coaſt, charged us ſo vigorouſly from their Lodges and Retrenchments, by continually firing upon us both with great and ſmall ſhot, whilſt on the other ſide, the Caſtle likewiſe thundred upon us with their Cannon that many of our <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Canoes</hi> were ſunk thereby, and we forced to retreat with loſs back to our Ships: That day we made no other attack, but obliged our <hi>Negroes</hi> to retire on board with us, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the next day to make a freſh Aſſault, as we did with more ſucceſs. For in the Night ſome of the principal of the <hi>English Negroes</hi> came on board Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> promiſing him to let us Land without oppoſition. In anſwer to which welcome proffer we made them a preſent of a Tun of Brandy, and ſome glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſuch as the <hi>Negroes</hi> uſe; after which, they retired. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> obſerving the good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they were in towards us, Reſolved to make his beſt advantage of it, and accordingly without loſing time, ordered a ſecond deſcent
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:29562:154"/> to be made. Our Whites incluſively with their Officers were 750 Men, and our Blacks 500. The <hi>Negroes</hi> that held intelligence with us put up the Princes Colours upon the Ruines of the Caſtle of <hi>Anamabo</hi> which had been blown up a little before, ſo that we Landed without any reſiſtance from the <hi>Negroes,</hi> but yet not without a great deal of danger by reaſon of the Roughneſs of the Sea. About noon we began to come near the Caſtle of <hi>Cormantine,</hi> whilſt ſome of our Ships getting in a line under the Caſtle as near it as poſſibly they could, play'd hotly upon it with their Guns, and battered it to ruin with much ſucceſs. In the mean while our men marching up in a cloſe body to the <hi>Negroes</hi> that held ſtill for the <hi>English</hi> put them to the Rout, and forced them to Retire back towards their Commander named <hi>John Gabia,</hi> who having raiſed a Battery of 3 great Guns upon a hill, galled us extreamly; But our Troops deſpiſing that danger forced them at length to retire and leave their Cannon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and advanced juſt under the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Our <hi>Negroes</hi> likewiſe fought with much bravery, ſet fire on the <hi>English Negroes</hi> Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and cut off the heads of as many of them as they could catch, and carried them away with them, leaving their Bodies in the Field of Battle, becauſe we had promiſed them a fixt Reward for every Head; but ſeveral of our Negroes were likewiſe killed and wounded. As ſoon as they in the Caſtle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived what Progreſs we had made, they put up a white Flag, and demanded Quarter, ſo that we made our ſelves Maſters of it with little Loſs. It was defended with 32 Pieces of Cannon, and a Garriſon of 52 Men. The General of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, above-mentioned, having ſeveral times ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the Governour to blow up the Caſtle, and being refuſed, was ſo enraged at it, that he cut
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:29562:155"/> two of his Childrens, and two of his Nephews Throats, and then ſtabbing himſelf ſeveral times into the Throat and Belly, he threw himſelf down from the Walls of the Caſtle, which not killing him out-right, he crept behind a Rock, and was there found dead. We gave Quarter to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh:</hi> After which, our Officers placed good Guards every where, and the better to prevent any Inſolences that might happen from the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they forbad them all ſorts of ſtrong Drink. But the next Day, as our Barges drew near the Shore, to take in our Men, an infinite Number of <hi>Negroes</hi> flockt together, from all pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts about the Caſtle, and flew fiercely upon all that offered to ſtir out of it, cutting off the Heads of all that reſiſted them, without any further Ceremony; ſo that we loſt more Men that way than we had done in the Aſſault. But our Men thereupon fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Caſtle Guns upon them, killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great many Negroes, and put the reſt to Flight; which ſo terrified them, that a little while after, the General of the Negroes appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Caſtle, with a white Flag, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace, and free Commerce, which being granted them, they retired. And then all our Men, but what were to be left in Garriſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again on Board the Fleet. One <hi>Samuel Smith,</hi> of <hi>Gravenweert,</hi> a native of <hi>Guelderland,</hi> and Merchant of <hi>Morea,</hi> was choſen Governour of the new-taken Caſtle. And then, in mark of our Victory, all the Guns were diſcharged both from the Caſtle and the Men of War. On the 12th of <hi>February</hi> we unmoored from thence, and on the 13th came to an Anchor before the Caſtle <hi>del Mina;</hi> where we were well received; ſo that after we had ſet all things in order there, put on Board the Cheſts of Gold, and taken in a Proviſion of freſh Water, we ſet ſail the 27th of <hi>February,</hi> 1665. tacking about to the South-ward. On the 8th of <hi>March</hi> we paſſed the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:29562:155"/> Line,</hi> and on the third of <hi>April,</hi> in the Morning, the Wind being riſen higher, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed it again. On the 6th of the ſame Month Captain <hi>Byland</hi> died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the next Day his Body was committed to the Deep, in the Latitude of 1 degree and 4 minutes. On the 30th of <hi>April,</hi> about Noon, we arrived before the Iſland of the <hi>Barbados,</hi> where we found 40 <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which we forced aſhore, after ſome Hours firing upon them. We likewiſe fired ſo hotly upon the Caſtle, that we beat down the Walls, and forced the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to run away in Troops. However, the Seamen belonging to the <hi>English</hi> Ships, making at firſt ſome Reſiſtance, we had ſome Men killed and wounded on our ſide; but when we made up towards them, to grapple them, we had like to have run aground, which obliged us to ſheer off further from the Coaſt, and then we caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor; yet we continued to fire without Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon them, till we ſhattered them all to pieces. From thence we ſailed away to <hi>Martini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> where we buried our dead Men: And after we had paid thoſe laſt Honours to them, we ſet ſail again, and took divers Prizes in the Iſlands of <hi>Montferrat, Nevis,</hi> and <hi>Guadaloupe;</hi> forcing them every where to flie under the Shelter of their Caſtles. Some we burnt, and ſome we ſold at <hi>S. Martins</hi> and <hi>S. Chriſtophers</hi> Iſlands, and the reſt, that ſailed well, we carried home with us. The 15th of <hi>June</hi> we arrived before <hi>Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where we took 8 Prizes more, ſeizing on their Merchandiſes and Effects, but burning the Ships. We found there abundance of Salt Cod, and ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bread; which came very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely to us. And then unmooring, we ſet ſail again. On the 9th of <hi>July</hi> we coaſted along the Iſles of <hi>Fero,</hi> and on the 23d we arrived in the Country of <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Norway;</hi> where, by a Galliot that was cruiſing there to wait for the homeward-bound <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships, we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

But the Calmneſs of the Weather, or contrary Winds, forced us to luff. In our way, from time to time, we ſpoke with ſome Barks, who inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, being 80 Sail ſtrong, was cruiſing before our Coaſts; but we thank God, for having made us take Care to avoid them, fince we were in no condition to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted them, altho' we would not have failed to do our utmoſt to have done it.</p>
                  <p>On the 6th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1665. we arrived with a contrary Wind, to the weſtward of <hi>Eems,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Delfzyl;</hi> where we lie expecting freſh Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

The Day following, as they were deliberat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Preſence about the Departure of the Fleet, he renewed his Complaints, tho' in very reſpectful, yet very reſolute Terms; telling the Deputies, That he prayed them to be pleaſed to diſcharge him from his Employment, at leaſt for that time, ſince he could not aſſiſt at that Expedition ſo much againſt his Heart, without doing extreme violence to himſelf. Adding, That in any other Occaſions, he would never refuſe to give all deſirable Proofs of his Zeal, and ſtedfaſt Affection for the Service of his Country. The Deputies of the States hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conferred thereupon with the Deputies of the College of the Admiralty, repreſented to him, That his Honour was in that matter no way touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or offended, and therefore earneſtly adviſed him to wave that needleſs and unſeaſonable Nicety, and to think only of doing his Duty. But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtill obſtinately to urge a Diſmiſſion from his Employment, they at laſt anſwered him, That they had no Power to diſcharge him, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending againſt the Reſolution taken by their High and Mightineſſes, on the 11th of that Month; but that if he would needs perſiſt in his Intention, he might ſolicit his Diſmiſſion himſelf, by a Letter to their High and Mightineſſes. However, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch an occaſion, to do him a Pleaſure, they would joyn their own Inſtances to the States with his, by writing to them to back his Requeſt; but that in the mean while he was obliged to ſtay for their Anſwer, or at leaſt till their High and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſes ſhould ſend particular Orders to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, directing them how they ſhould regulate
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:29562:158"/> themſelves in ſuch a Circumſtance as that: And that tho' he ſhould obtain his Diſcharge, yet he could not in Reaſon withdraw himſelf till after the Arrival of Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> to the Fleet. After ſuch an Anſwer, <hi>Tromp</hi> left the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, with a wavering Mind, whether he had beſt to write to the States or not.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Deputies, without mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of thoſe private Diſguſts and Differences, cauſed all imaginable Diligence to be uſed to get the Fleet into a Readineſs ſpeedily to unmoor, as being convinced by Experience, that a favourable, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſail out, being once neglected, was not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to be met withal again, eſpecially when they conſidered, they muſt be forced to ſtay for an Eaſt-Wind, to get out of the Harbours, and get the Fleet over the dangerous Places.</p>
            <p>The States of <hi>Holland</hi> having been informed by a Letter from Mr. <hi>Witſen,</hi> ancient Burgo Maſter of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and from Mr. Penſionary <hi>de Wit,</hi> written from the <hi>Texel,</hi> That Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> appeared unwilling to ſerve at Sea under the Command of <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> ſignified their Thoughts thereupon to their Deputies, in the following Letter.</p>

            <p>And the Intention of the States was accordingly executed; but <hi>Tromp,</hi> whether he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his own accord, or were over-perſuaded to it by his Friends, conformed to the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the States.</p>
            <p>In the mean while there aroſe a great Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion among the Seamen of Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Ship, about weighing Anchor, which they refuſed to do, but in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Name: And their Inſolence tranſported them ſo far, as to rebel againſt their Officers, who made a ſhift to appeaſe them for a while, with gentle Words; but the Tumult began again ſoon after afreſh, when the Cook came to ſerve them out their Victuals: For not being content with what was given them, they ran with their Porringers, to the Captain's
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:29562:159"/> Cabbin, making a horrid Noiſe, till at laſt the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, taking notice who were the Ringleaders of the Diſorder, ſeized them, and put them in Hold, in order to have them puniſhed according to their Deſerts; and a Council of War being called to ſit upon them, after having heard the Criminals, on the 11th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> condemned two of the moſt faulty of them, to be hanged, to ſerve for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all the reſt of the Seamen and Soldiers. For that effect, two Bills were put into a Diſh, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Napkin, whereof one had in it the figure of a Gallows, and the other was a Blank, and they being made to draw for their Lives, he that drew the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows was hanged on the Main Yard, and the other was whipt, markt with the States Arms, and then turned aſhore, as unworthy to ſerve any more.</p>
            <p>3 Days after, being the 14th of the Month, a great part of the Fleet put out to Sea, and the Day after the reſt followed them, to which the indefatigable Care of Mr. Penſionary <hi>de Wit</hi> did not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, by the ſingular Pains he took to ſee all the Parts of the <hi>Texel</hi> ſounded, through which they were to paſs; where he found in ſome Places 4 Foot of Water more than the Sounders ever found before, which in all likelihood happened by their Careleſneſs, ſo that it was thought not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to get out at 28 Points of the Compaſs. The Fleet was then compoſed of 96 Sail of Men of War, and 22 Fireſhips and Advice Yachts, and was divided into 3 Squadrons.</p>
            <p>We ſhall here, by the way, deſire you to take notice, That the Commander <hi>Vander Hulſt</hi> had been not long before made Vice-Admiral by the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> for the College of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in the Place of <hi>Tromp,</hi> who was raiſed to the Dignity of Lieutenant-Admiral of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> vacant by the Death of <hi>Kortenaar,</hi> and that <hi>Cornelius Evertzen</hi> had been named by the College of <hi>Zealand,</hi> to ſupply the Place of his Brother <hi>John Evertſz,</hi> in Quality of Lieutenant-Admiral,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:29562:160"/> who was diſpenſed with from ſerving in this Expedition.</p>

            <p>Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> was conſidered in that Regulation as the chief Commander of the Fleet, and all was done in his Name, becauſe Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was not yet come thither. <hi>Tromp</hi> alſo eſtabliſhed an Order concerning the general <hi>Rendezvous</hi> of the Fleet, in Caſe of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by Tempeſt, or by the Darkneſs of the Night that ſhould make them loſe Sight of their Flag. And that Order was regulated according to Times, Opportunities, and the Winds that ſhould happen to prevail.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> arrived in the <hi>Texel,</hi> the 16th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> where there were left three Frigats, to conduct him to the Fleet, but by a contrary Wind he was detained till next day Morning, when he ſet ſail accompanied with <hi>Van Nes,</hi> who had taken the Oath in Quality of Vice-Admiral of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> at the ſame time that <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was ſworn in the <hi>Texel,</hi> before the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the States General, in quality of Lieutenant Admiral of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-frieſland,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in Chief. He therefore went to the Mouth of the <hi>Spaniſh Hole,</hi> where he went on Board the Frigat, <hi>Schiedam,</hi> carrying 25 Guns and 81 Men, and the next Morning he arrived on Board the Ship called the <hi>Amity,</hi> then commanded by Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> where he was received by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the States with great Demonſtrations of Kindneſs. <hi>Tromp</hi> likewiſe ſhewed a great deal of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:29562:161"/> good Temper and Moderation towards him, by ſmothering in Silence a part of his Reſentments, which already gave the Nation great Hopes they would ſhortly be perfectly reconciled.</p>
            <p>Whilſt things were thus paſſing on the Side of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, under the Command of the Admirals, <hi>Mountague, Pen,</hi> and <hi>Allen,</hi> had made an Excurſion towards the North, to cruiſe there againſt the Ships belonging to the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Company, that were expected coming homewards; but they having had time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notice of it by ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Galliots, happily retired into the Harbour of <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> to the Number of 10 Ships; and two more belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame Company went into <hi>Drontheim;</hi> and beſides them, there were 60 Merchant-ſhips more richly laden, bound homewards to <hi>Holland.</hi> The Admirals of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, upon that News, were deſperately enraged they had let ſlip ſo rich a Booty out of their Chops, ſo that calling a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, they reſolved to attack the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Bay, whether they could get the Governour of <hi>Bergen</hi>'s conſent or no, with Deſign and Hopes to take, or at leaſt burn and deſtroy their Fleet there. They ſent therefore to the ſaid Governour, named <hi>Aleveld,</hi> to deſire his Conſent to their Enterprize, who being unprovided then with Guns and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition ſufficient to reſiſt them, held them off 3 Days with fair Words, telling them, He durſt not let them attempt upon any Ships in that his Maſter's Port, without expreſs Orders from his Majeſty, to whom he would ſend to know his Pleaſure about it, conjuring them, in the mean time, not to offer by any Hoſtility to violate the Liberty of his Maſter's Harbours. But after 3 Days, during which he had ſupplied himſelf with Guns, Powder and all other Neceſſaries from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships and elſewhere, having ſent the <hi>English</hi> a flat Refuſal, they detached away Captain <hi>Tyddeman</hi> with a Squadron of 14 Men of War with 3 Fireſhips and 2

                  <p>THE <hi>English</hi> having had advice, that we were arrived here with a Fleet of 10 ſhips from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> were in an unconceivable vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at it; ſo that the day before yeſterday they came and poſted themſelves between the two Caſtles that defend the entrance of the Port, with a Squadron of 14 Men of War, 3 Fire-ſhips, and 4 Advice Yachts, making in all 21 ſail, and fell upon our Fleet with ſo much fury, that we were forced to ſtand up in our own defence, and by the help of the Caſtles, and of ſome batteries we had raiſed on ſhore againſt them with Guns drawn out of our ſhips we repulſed them with ſo much ſucceſs, that after a fight of about 3 hours and a half, they were forced to cut their Cables, and ſhamefully betake themſelves to flight. We are told for certain, that whilſt they were retreating 3 of their Ships ſunk, whereof one carried an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals Flag. It appears by the marks of their defeat, that they were very ſeverely handled, ſince 30 of their dead men were caſt aſhore by the Waves, who were ſtrip'd by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and 6 of their ſhips were ſo battered, that they were forced to Anchor, at about 3 miles from hence, to patch themſelves up again as well as they could, being able no longer to keep the Sea.</p>
                  <p>We had in this fight 25 men killed, and 70 wounded; and we loſt the Merchant, Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter de Sandvlied,</hi> after he had ſhewn a great
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:29562:162"/> deal of Bravery. The Maſts, Sails and Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our ſhips are extreamely endamaged, ſo that they will take us up ſeveral days time to repair them. We have reaſon to thank God for having ſo powerfully protected us. A Merchant ſhip of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> Commanded by the Maſter <hi>Ruth Maximilian,</hi> fought valiantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Example of our men, and ſo did General <hi>Alefelt,</hi> and the Governour <hi>Van Steignon,</hi> who after he had done all he could to divert the <hi>English</hi> from their deſign by fair words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effect, have at laſt by the force of their Arms, and the powerfull Rhetorick of the Cannon of their Caſtles, maintained their rights, and the Protection they had granted to ſtrangers, ſo that all things ſucceeded to the honour of the Victors. Three Months pay Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was granted on this occaſion both to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of our ſhips, as of thoſe of the Merchants, by way of reward for their good Service, who were employed either on board our ſhips, or elſe on ſhore in managing the Batteries there erected for our defence; which is to be paid by all the ſhips which are here and we hope you will not take that proceeding ill from us, ſince it was put in practice only to raiſe the Courage of the men in that preſſing occaſion, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them the more vigorouſly to repulſe a bold and potent Enemy who came with a greedy and eager Appetite, to ſeize upon ſo much riches, the loſs of which would have been very heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible to you. The bearer of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches can inform you more fully of the other Circumſtances of this Fight, becauſe he was an Eye-Witneſs of all that paſſed in it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Advice we have had from ſeveral Perſons, that paſt laſt <hi>Sunday</hi> near the Enemies Fleet, about 20 miles to the Weſtward of <hi>Schuitenes,</hi> we thought we had ſome reaſon to fear, they would attempt a ſecond charge upon us; which
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:29562:163"/> makes us put in practice all things that may tend to ſecure our preſervation; having for that effect, pray'd the Governour to Order the Barrier to be repaired that ſhuts up the Port, that ſo being ſhut up, we may be in ſafe ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Fire-ſhips. We alſo have intreated him to repair the works and Batteries, and put them into a better condition, as likewiſe to cauſe ſome new works to be raiſed in convenient pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to plant Cannon upon. And he has aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us, he will take care to have all things done that may contribute to the ſecurity of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of the King his Maſter; that we are at preſent buſied in tranſporting to ſhore 20 peices of Cannon out of our ſhips and 10 more out of the Merchants ſhips, which we can very well ſpare by reaſon of the ſmallneſs of the Port, to be employed there in our defence; we will likewiſe endeavour to make a Fire-ſhip if we can perſwade one of our Merchants to give us his ſhip for that uſe. All things being ſo Ordered, we hope under the Protection of God ſufficiently to provide for the ſecurity of ſo rich a Booty as that intruſted with us, by vigorouſly repulſing the attacks of the <hi>English</hi> in which we implore the aſſiſtance and bleſſing of God; and we promiſe on our part to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thereto with all that ſhall lie in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>English</hi> loſt in that attack, 2 Captains, with one of <hi>Mountague</hi>'s Sons, and 3 men of War, whereof one ſtuck in the Rocks, out of which the <hi>Dutch</hi> took the Guns, to employ them in their own defence. And the Wooden Poſts that formed the Barrier of the Haven were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>implaced in Order to ſecure the Fleet from the <hi>English</hi> Fire-ſhips. But they durſt not venture upon another charge, but tackt about towards their main Fleet, quitting the Rocks of <hi>Norway</hi> to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:29562:163"/> make the beſt of their way towards their own Country: And ſo by that means the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhips that were pregnant with immenſe Riches, the ſhips alone that came from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> being valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at above 12 Millions of Livers, or one Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion Sterling, were delivered from the diſaſters, that threatned them. When Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was arrived in the Fleet, as we have ſaid, it was thought fit, by the Advice of all the reſt of the General Officers, that the States Deputies and Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> ſhould remove out of the ſhip <hi>Amity,</hi> into the <hi>Delfland,</hi> called for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the <hi>Great Spaniard,</hi> and that each Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of the Fleet ſhould make a detachment of 7 Frigats, or bigger Men of War, with ſome Fire-ſhips, to form a 4th. Squadron for Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> who had to Command it under him, <hi>Aart Van Nes,</hi> Vice-Admiral of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and <hi>Frederick Staghouwer,</hi> Rear-Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of the North. They likewiſe regulated the placing of the Flags, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Squadron ſhould bear it on their main maſt; that of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Cornelius Evertſz,</hi> on their mizzen-maſt, the Squadron of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> on the Poop, and that of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tierk Hiddes,</hi> on the Fore maſt.</p>
            <p>All the World begun already to conceive great Hopes of ſo formidable a Fleet, commanded by 2 of the greateſt men of the Age, and directed by the Council of the wiſeſt Deputies of the State.</p>
            <p>Things being in that Condition, there Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained nothing but to form ſome Noble Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize that might raiſe the Glory of the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the Courage of the Seamen that was pall'd by the ill ſucceſs of the laſt fight. And accordingly the Deputies, and Admiral <hi>de Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> with the reſt of the General Officers of the Fleet Reſolved to ſail towards the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> as thinking they might meet
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:29562:164"/> at ſome advantage with the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, as they were ſuppoſed to be coming back laden with the ſpoils of the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> ſhips, or at leaſt might ſuccour theſe latter and reſcue them out of the Enemies hands. That project ſeemed well contrived, but a contrary Wind hindred the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it, for growing more boiſterous and turning quite oppoſite againſt them, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Fleet to ſteer to the North-ward; which at the ſame time favoured the retreat of the <hi>English.</hi> On the 25th. of the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Advanc'd guard of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet having purſued two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Advice Yachts, took them, and by their means were informed, that the <hi>English</hi> Fleet conſiſting of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 70 ſail of Men of War, had been cruiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome days upon the Coaſt of <hi>Norway,</hi> to hunt after the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> ſhips; but that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards purſuing their courſe on the 18th. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Hitland,</hi> they came to an Anchor in the bay of <hi>Breezond,</hi> having left upon the Coaſts of <hi>Norway</hi> a Squadron of 20 ſhips under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Captain <hi>Tyddeman;</hi> and that on the 23d. having unmoored from <hi>Hitland,</hi> they put out to Sea again. On the 25th. of the ſame Month, the Advanced guard of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet diſcovered an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man of War of the white Squadron, ſo that they found by that, the two Fleets were pretty near one another, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to ſee one another, or to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what courſe each other ſteer'd. During theſe tranſactions, the <hi>Dutch</hi> reſolved to ſail with all poſſible diligence towards <hi>Bergen,</hi> in hopes to meet and maul the ſmall <hi>Engliſh</hi> Squadron in thoſe parts; and accordingly on the 29th. the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Fleet arrived upon the Coaſt of <hi>Norway,</hi> and heard there by the report of ſome Galliots, that the <hi>English</hi> had attack the <hi>Dutch</hi> homeward bound <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> ſhips in the Port of <hi>Bergen,</hi> as likewiſe other <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant ſhips that were
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:29562:164"/> retired thither, but that, after a fight of 3 hours and a half, they were forced to cut their Anchor Cables, and ſhamefully to flie away with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable loſs and damage. So, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet had not only miſt of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, but arrived too late before <hi>Bergen,</hi> to attach <hi>Tyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deman.</hi>

            <p>In the mean time the States Deputies received a Letter from Captain <hi>Bitter</hi> that Commanded in chief the Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> ſhips; who ſignified to them, that ſince the fight with the <hi>English,</hi> things there went very ſtrangely: For that Mr. <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt</hi> or <hi>Aleveld,</hi> General of the <hi>Danish</hi> Troops in <hi>Norway,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Steignon,</hi> Governour of the Town and Caſtles of <hi>Bergen,</hi> who told the <hi>Dutch</hi> very roundly, that if they expected they ſhould continue their care to protect them from the oppreſſion of the <hi>English,</hi> they muſt pay them down on the nail the ſum of 100000 Crowns to ſatisfie them and the reſt of the Officers and Soldiers for the pains and hazard they had been at in their defence; and that when they ſhould have received that money, they would be ready to ſacrifice their Lives and Eſtates againſt all that ſhould attempt upon the liberty of their Harbours adding, that for the love they had to the United Provinces, they would act freely with them and without any manner of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; That the <hi>English</hi> from whom they had much more advantageous Offers, if they would accept them, were but two or three miles from <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen:</hi> And that the account they were to render to the King their Maſter about obſerving a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality was not the leaſt bar to them in that caſe; that therefore they expected the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould immediately ſatisfie their demand in ready caſh or upon their default, they knew where to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves, and in two days time would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to make a ſerious reflection upon the premiſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="316" facs="tcp:29562:165"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Bitter</hi> added, that he had anſwered them that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants there were not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition out of their own Money to pay ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a ſum; that a recompence of ſuch a value as that was the concern of the State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and that no private Perſon ought to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it. However he told his Maſters that he had endeavoured to drill on the affair with them to what length he could, by paying them 3000 Crowns in hand, and that they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Collection of 8 or 10000 Crowns more amongſt the Merchant men come from <hi>Spain,</hi> which ſum was to be imployed in fortifying the Caſtle where a great many men were already at work for that effect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The States had named Lieutenant Colonel <hi>de Gent,</hi> the Colonels <hi>Dolman,</hi> and <hi>Maregnault</hi> the Lieutenant Colonel <hi>de Santen,</hi> and Serjeant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Wynbergen,</hi> to Command the Troops on board their Fleet. And before the Deputies had received <hi>Bitter</hi>'s Letter, they had ſent the firſt of thoſe Officers to the Governour of <hi>Bergen</hi> to compliment him in their Name, and to return him thanks for the Protection he had granted to the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhips in his Port, and to deſire him at the ſame time to continue it, and to order things ſo, that the Merchant Fleet there might ſpeedily be diſmiſt out of that Harbour, and ſail out to ſecure themſelves under the Admiral Flag of the States Grand Fleet. Mr. <hi>de Gent</hi> was accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Governour with great marks of reſpect: Upon which the Deputies having ſome reliance, writ to <hi>Bitter</hi> to uſe all the diligence he could to get the Ships out of that Port, as being perſwaded the <hi>Danes</hi> would not offer to oppoſe their going; but withal aſſuring him, that if he feared they would make any difficulty to let them quietly depart, that they might expect all the aſſiſtance imaginable from the powerfull Fleet that was ſo near at hand, at their diſpoſal. But
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:29562:165"/> alas the very noiſe alone of the arrival of that Fleet upon the Coaſts of <hi>Norway,</hi> made Affairs there change face immediately, and after that the <hi>Dutch</hi> heard no more from the <hi>Danes</hi> of their demand of 100000 Crowns. On the contrary, they agreeably and obligingly conſented to the departure of their Merchant ſhips, but yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to reſtore 41 pieces of Cannon that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had drawn out of their Eaſt-<hi>India,</hi> and other Merchant ſhips, to be imployed part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Caſtle, and partly in Batteries raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſhore, during the late fight with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For when the <hi>Dutch</hi> redemanded them, the <hi>Danes</hi> anſwered, that they had need of them themſelves for their own defence againſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> whom they had incenſed againſt them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their account; ſo that with all the <hi>Dutch</hi> could do or ſay, they could never perſwade them to part with them again.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and other Merchant ſhips had joyned the Grand Fleet of men of War, they unmoor'd from the Bay of <hi>Bergen,</hi> at the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and about 4 days after were ſaluted by ſo terrible a Tempeſt that they were almoſt all entirely ſcattered one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And beſides the loſs of two Fire-Ships that were caſt away, there were many Ships ſhrewdly endamaged. Two <hi>East-India</hi> Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Golden Phoenix,</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningen,</hi> and 4 men of War, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Weſt-Frieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Groningen,</hi> the <hi>De Zevenwolden,</hi> and the <hi>Hope,</hi> being ſeparated from the Admiral's Flag, by the ill Weather, fell into the hands of the <hi>English</hi> near the Dogger-Sand. And ſome days after, the Ships, <hi>Huis te Swieten,</hi> the <hi>Cavaleer</hi> of <hi>Guelders</hi> the <hi>St. Paul of Zealand,</hi> and the <hi>St. Paul of Enkhuizen,</hi> together with 3 Merchant Ships, 2 Fire Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were likewiſe taken, being drawn into the ſnare by the treachery of a Pilot of <hi>Bremen,</hi> who being askt, whether he could
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:29562:166"/> tell any news of the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> anſwered, that he had ſeen them paſs by about 80 ſail ſtrong, and ſo councelling them to ſteer to the Eaſt-South-Eaſt, cruelly betrayed the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into their Enemies mouths. However the <hi>Dutch</hi> grand Fleet made a ſhift to get back about the 24 of <hi>September,</hi> and to come moſt part of them to an Anchor, in <hi>Goree,</hi> without coming to any Action, except it were Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Van Nes,</hi> who fired ſome Guns upon ſome <hi>English</hi> Ships that would have taken from him two <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships, but no fight enſued, becauſe the <hi>English</hi> thought fit to ſheer off, and leave them to purſue their voyage.</p>
            <p>A little time after, the taking of thoſe Ships, the <hi>English</hi> Fleet ſteer'd away homewards for their own Harbours, and on the 21ſt. at night the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> came to an Anchor in <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay,</hi> with a Squadron of 18 men of War, two <hi>East-India</hi> Ships, and ſome other prizes taken from the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as appears by the Letter he writ from thence to General <hi>Monk,</hi> whereof here follows the Copy.</p>

                     </note>I Hope my laſt, dated the 5th. of this month, was delivered you, by which I informed you of the taking of the Vice and Rear Admirals of the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Fleet, 4 of their men of War, and 3 or 4 other Merchant Ships. Since which on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 9th.

As for this laſt rencounter I cannot yet tell you all the Circumſtances of it, becauſe the Wind riſing in the night, and the darkneſs redoubling, we were ſeparated one from an other.

I have reſolved to ſend the Great Ships with the Prizes, into the River of <hi>Chattam,</hi> on the firſt Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to leave the moſt part of the ſmall Frigats at <hi>Hartly-Bay,</hi> and <hi>Harwich.</hi> We have made 1000 Priſoners on board our laſt Prizes.

            <p>Thus the <hi>English</hi> retired into their Harbours, laden with the Spoils of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> In which Tranſaction, it ſeems ſomething ſtrange, the two Fleets ſhould come ſo near one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fighting, ſince their Vanguards were ſometimes near enough to have engaged; but it is thought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> intended nothing leſs than a Fight, when they ſaw ſo fair an Occaſion to make a Rich Booty without it.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Dutch</hi> uſed all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Induſtry, to aſſemble their Fleet before <hi>Goree,</hi> and to get them in readineſs to go out once more in ſearch after the <hi>English,</hi> and to engage them, if poſſible, to a Battle. But a horrible Tempeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing on the 29th of <hi>September,</hi> ſo endamaged moſt of their Ships, that they were glad to retire again into their Ports. But however, <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> in ſpite of all thoſe croſs and miſchievous Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, unmoored on the 5th of <hi>October</hi> following, from before <hi>Goree,</hi> to go into the <hi>Texel,</hi> and joyn
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:29562:167"/> the other freſh Ships there, with Deſign after he had taken in a Supply of neceſſary Proviſions, to ſail out with them towards the Coaſts of <hi>England.</hi> And on the 11th the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, conſiſting of about 90 Sail of Men of War, weighed Anchor, with a Reſolution, to go and attack the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> at <hi>Solbay,</hi> at <hi>Harwich,</hi> in the <hi>Thames,</hi> or in the <hi>Downs;</hi> for which effect, the States Deputies had taken care to detach away ſome Yachts and Galliots, to go out a ſcouting towards thoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to get what Intelligence they could of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to ſpie out the Number of their Ships. And one of thoſe Yachts and a Galliot, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, met the Grand Fleet on the 12th off of <hi>Schoowen,</hi> and reported, They had ſeen 23 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships behind the Banks of <hi>Harwich,</hi> and that ſome <hi>French</hi> Fiſhermen had aſſured them, The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet was not yet come out. Relying upon that Report, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> appeared on the 15th be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Yarmouth</hi> and <hi>Layſtoff,</hi> where they took a ſmall Bark, and enquiring of the Priſoners taken in it, how all things ſtood, they anſwered, That they knew nothing but only that the great <hi>English</hi> Men of War had orders not to ſtir out, and that there were none at all on the Northern Coaſts; that the laſt week before there died in <hi>London</hi> 9000 People of the Plague, and that ſeveral other great Towns in the Kingdom were afflicted with the ſame pernicious Diſeaſe. The next Day, the Fleet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards <hi>Solbay,</hi> where they found no Ships at all. In the mean while, all the Coaſt was in an alarm; and the People of <hi>Suffolk</hi> were up in Arms, and had fired the Beacons all-a-long the Sea-Coaſt, to give notice to the Inhabitants, that the Enemy was upon their Coaſt. On the ſame Day, 16 of the King's Ships having had notice of the Approach of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, unmoored from <hi>Harwich,</hi> and retired into the <hi>Thames.</hi> On the 17th the <hi>Dutch</hi> were reſolved to make ſail towards <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> acroſs the Banks, but were hindred by a
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:29562:167"/> contrary Wind; and therefore ſteered towards the <hi>Thames,</hi> where they ſaw 13 <hi>English</hi> Men of War go in, which they could not poſſibly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, becauſe our Men were near 3 Miles off from the Body of the Grand Fleet. It was ſuppoſed, they were the Ships that were come from <hi>Harwich.</hi> The next night, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet anchored at the Mouth of the River, and on the 18th they unmoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made off for the <hi>Downs,</hi> thinking to block up the Paſſage thither, and to ſurprize the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships they ſhould find there. But that Project was broken either by contrary Winds, or Calms, if it had not been for which they might have taken 5 <hi>English</hi> Men of War and 3 or 4 Privateers, who by that means had time to eſcape. However, the Fleet returned again to the <hi>Thames;</hi> and on the laſt Day of the Month, the Lords Deputies, with the Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> went on Board the Frigat <hi>Gornichem,</hi> and with 3 Galliots accompanying them, advanced a great way up the River, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a diſtance by <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s and <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons. About a mile from thence they found the River very large and deep, and the next evening after they had taken a View of all things, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Fleet. But all thoſe Precautions were but needleſs, becauſe they were founded only upon the Advice they had had, that an <hi>English</hi> Fleet, to the Number of about 60 Sail, of ſtout Men of War, was ready to ſail out of the <hi>Thames,</hi> with intent to give Battle to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and chaſe them from the Coaſts of <hi>England;</hi> which proved falſe, for they offered not to ſtir out.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Winter</hi> was coming on, and Mortal Diſeaſes began cruelly to rage in the Fleet; where 140 Seamen were already dead, 355 had been ſent back ſick into <hi>Holland,</hi> and there were reckoned 970 more to remain ſtill in the Fleet. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> had 34 Sick on board him, beſides 33 more he had ſent home before. On the 1ſt of <hi>November,</hi> all the General and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:29562:168"/> Officers in the Fleet were ſummoned on Board the Admiral, to give him a more particular account what condition they were in, by whoſe Report it appeared, That ſome Captains who had all their Men healthy and ſound, but on the 27th of the laſt Month, complained, that ſince that time they had had one with another 40 Men apiece ſick on board them. And Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> was one of the moſt unfortunate in that Rencounter, having in two days time 50 Soldiers taken ſick in his Ship alone. Vice-Admiral <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kert</hi> reported likewiſe, That the Day before 20 of his Men had had the ſame Misfortune. So that every Captain complaining in that manner of the number of ſick Men they had on Board their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Ships, the Deputies, and the Generals of the Fleet, judged thereupon, That it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remedy thoſe Diſaſters, and that therefore it was beſt for them to retire home, and that ſo much the rather, becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> appeared not at Sea, and that the Tempeſtuous Weather, that coming on with the <hi>Winter,</hi> would not permit them to ſtay any longer there. Purſuant to which Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 6 light Frigats, and 4 Galliots were detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away to go and cruiſe for 3 Days at the Mouth of the <hi>Thames,</hi> both to advertiſe the Ships that might have been ſent from <hi>Holland</hi> to the Fleet, and to ſeek out the Ships that belonged to the Flag, to give them notice of the Departure of the Fleet. They thought likewiſe fit to order a Squadron of 18 Ships, whoſe Men were as yet all ſound, to keep the Sea three Weeks longer; the Command of which was given to <hi>Sweers,</hi> who was made Rear-Admiral of the Admiralty of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Death of <hi>de Wilde.</hi> He had Orders to cruiſe about the <hi>Dogger ſand</hi> till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>December,</hi> and to do his beſt to go to meet the Ships bound homewards from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and that were expected back from <hi>Norway,</hi> in order to convoy them ſafe home; and at the ſame
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:29562:168"/> time, to have an Eye upon the <hi>English</hi> Merchant-Ships, coming out of the <hi>Sound,</hi> or from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> towards the <hi>Thames,</hi> or that ſhould come out of the <hi>Thames,</hi> to go towards the North, commanding him to give them Chace, and to do all he could to burn them, ſink them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Day, <hi>viz.</hi> the 1ſt of <hi>November,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, the Fleet ſet ſail, and tackt about, and ſtood to the Eaſtward. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Cornelius Evertſz</hi> led the Right Wing, Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries</hi> the left, and the Squadrons of <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and <hi>Tromp</hi> compoſed the Main Battle. The next Day <hi>de Ruiter</hi> put up a White Flag upon his Miz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Maſt, and fired 3 Guns for a Signal to the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons to ſeparate. The Lieutenant Admirals, <hi>Tromp, Evertſz,</hi> and <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries</hi> anſwered the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, according to the Order ſettled for that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, each of them with 7 Guns, Each Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with 5, and each Rear-Admiral with 3. And then Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> replied to all thoſe Admirals, again, at once, with 9 Guns; and ſo the ſeveral Squadrons of the Fleet quitted one another about Mid-way towards home; <hi>Tromp</hi> made towards <hi>Goree,</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>Zealand</hi> Squadron to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Lords Deputies of the States having quitted <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> landed on the 4th of <hi>November</hi> in a Galliot at the <hi>Helder,</hi> and thence went to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where they made their Report to the States General of what had paſſed in that Expedition, for which they received the Thanks of their High and Mightineſſes, as appears by the following Writing.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet then did nothing that Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but cauſe ſome Alarms upon the Coaſt of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and all the Honour they gained by it was only that of having offered Battle to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, whilſt they kept themſelves within their Harbours, as being debarred by a raging and peſtilent Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from accepting it, and having interrupted the Commerce of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, by keeping the Mouth of the <hi>Thames</hi> blockt up for about 16 Days together.

By an effect alſo of an over-great Confidence, neither did we recal our Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour preſently after your Majeſty had recalled yours, in hopes you would at laſt be pleaſed to make ſome Reflection upon the Miſchiefs a War would bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the two Nations. Your Majeſty alone is Witneſs of the advantageous Propoſitions that have been made you, in order to attain a Good and Solid Peace. We have offered to conclude it as your Majeſty should deſire, either that each Party should reſtore what they had taken from each other, or elſe that if <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> should think that beſt for its Intereſts, each ſide should keep and remain in poſſeſſion of their Conqueſts, and that with this Advantage for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> that thoſe Propoſitions might have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by your People at a Time when the <hi>United Provinces</hi> as yet were ignorant what had been taken from them in remote Countries. To which may be added, that it cannot be ſaid, That we flattered
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:29562:170"/> our ſelves with the Hopes of receiving any other Fruit from thence, than a bare indemnification for the Loſſes the States have ſuffered, incomparably greater than thoſe of <hi>England.</hi> Notwithſtanding all this, your Majeſty has not only refuſed to accept all theſe advantageous Conditions, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of the ſincere Deſire the States have for a Peace. But further, were not pleaſed to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thoſe other Propoſals ſo diſadvantageous to the States, offered you by the Mediation of <hi>France,</hi> which they never conſented to. Beſides, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would never make, or order any one to make, the leaſt Overture on your Side, of any Conditions upon which you pretended to enter into Negotiation with the States: And tho' you have been pleaſed to teſtifie to our Ambaſſadour, That you deſired nothing ſo heartily as Peace, yet you would never determine to make choice of any means by which it might be attained, or explain your Mind clearly thereupon, either to him or to the other Mediators. We are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, there is no Chriſtian Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> who would not chuſe rather at all times to prefer the Sweetneſs of a good Peace before the Miſchiefs of a Cruel War, how juſt ſoever it may be; and we make thereupon the ſame Judgment of your Majeſty's Sentiments, ſince you exerciſe the ſame Religion with us. But reflecting upon your Majeſty's manner of dealing with our Ambaſſador, in contempt even of thoſe advantageous Propoſitions made you by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours, tho' they were altogether contrary to the true Intereſts of our State, in that you would never vouchſafe to make any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that might ſerve for a Ground for us to treat upon together, we thought then that our Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour could no longer ſtay in the Court of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> without Injury to the Reputation of the State; and therefore have thought fit to recal him, and that ſo much the rather, becauſe by recalling yours, has been pleaſed to let us know you would not take it ill at our Hands. This shall not hinder, but that
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:29562:171"/> we ſhall ever retain a ſincere deſire to come to a good Accommodation, as ſoon as we shall have Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do it, in conjunction with our Allies. In the mean while, we shall wait the time till it shall pleaſe God to inſpire your Majeſty with ſuch Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may diſpoſe you to declare what your will is, and what are the Conditions that may reconcile us, that we may ſtop and prevent the Effuſion of ſo much Chriſtian Blood, which is now ſpilt, and ſtill ready to be ſpilt in this unhappy Quarrel. We can ſay, That we shall not be reſponſible for it, ſince both before and ſince the Rupture, we have done all we could imagine to be juſt and reaſonable, and that could be expected from us, and that we are ſtill actually in the ſame Mind, and yet without ever having been able hitherto to find out what your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Intention is upon that Subject. We will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wait till you have more Inclination for Peace; but yet it were to be wiſht, you would be brought to thoſe good Thoughts of your own accord, without ſtaying till the Miſchiefs and Diſaſters that are now ready to afflict Chriſtendom, inſpire them into you. We pray God to avert them, and to take, Sir, your Majeſty's Sacred Perſon into his holy Protection.</p>

            <p>That Treaty was a ſtroke of Thunder to the <hi>English,</hi> who were the more ſenſibly concerned at it, becauſe they had not heard the leaſt inkling of it, till they heard of its concluſion. For <hi>Dreyer</hi> the Secretary of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Embaſſy in <hi>Holland,</hi> was ſent <hi>incognito</hi> by the Miniſters of that Prince that were at the <hi>Hague</hi> Mr. <hi>Catiſius,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Klingenberg,</hi> immediately after the Concluſion of the Treaty, to the King their Maſter, to preſent it to him and get his Ratification, after which the Secretary came back again with all expedition to the <hi>Hague.</hi> This politick ſilence was the cauſe, that the <hi>English</hi> Reſident at the Court of <hi>Denmark</hi> had not time to advertiſe the Merchants of his Nation of it, ſo that all their effects were ſeized and confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated throughout the whole extent of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It's true the <hi>Danes</hi> proceedings on that occaſion had ſome appearance of Juſtice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, becauſe the <hi>English</hi> from the very time they made that Hoſtile attempt of which we have ſpoken, upon the Port of <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> had not only ſeized on the <hi>Danes</hi> Ships and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:29562:173"/> but had likewiſe taken their men Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, ſo that the Crown of <hi>Denmark</hi> in that Rencounter ſeemed to do no more than to uſe Repriſals, had it not afterwards appeared, that they had dealt perfidiouſly in that matter with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſecretly invited him to that Enterprize for which they afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared War againſt him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the United Provinces, in order to facilitate the Arming and manning out the Fleet, publiſh'd on the 1ſt. of <hi>February</hi> an Ordinance, forbidding all Merchant Ships, and Fiſhing veſſels, to ſtir out of their Harbours, upon pain of Confiſcation of their ſaid Ships and Goods: They likewiſe forbad the great and ſmall Fiſhery under the ſame penalties and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for forbidding the <hi>Greenland</hi> Fiſhery, was alſo renewed. But the States however, declared that their intention in all thoſe prohibitions, was to find them ſubſiſtance all the year, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alteration even after the Fleet ſhould be gone out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About that time, <hi>Tromp</hi> ſignified to the States that he ſhould be glad if they would pleaſe to change his Quality of Lieutenant Admiral of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>West-Frieſland,</hi> or of the College of the Admiralty of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> into that of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Admiral of the College of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which requeſt the States granted upon Condition he got the conſent of both thoſe Admiralties thereunto: ſo that having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, on the 6th. of <hi>February,</hi> he was created Lieutenant Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and on the 24th. of the ſame month, Vice Admiral <hi>Aart Van Nes,</hi> ſucceeded him in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Lieutenant Admiral of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>John Van Nes</hi> was made Rear Admiral.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the <hi>English</hi> being ſenſible of the great Force of ſo powerfull a League, made very great preparations for War on their
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:29562:173"/> ſide, and exerted as we may ſay the utmoſt of their efforts to make a vigorous reſiſtance: But becauſe money was wanting they were forced to borrow 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling more at great Intereſt, and beſides to help towards the defraying of the extraordinary charges of the War the two Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and the <hi>Fort of Huningen</hi> taken from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were ſold, which yielded the ſum of 1600000<hi>l.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>French</hi> King had firſt declared War againſt <hi>England,</hi> the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> who was no leſs Jealous of his honour than the Monſieur, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe a Declaration againſt that Crown, in the following Terms.</p>

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:29562:174"/> 12 Galliots, and 10 Fire-ſhips, who were joined with 6 of the States ſhips under the Command of <hi>Gedeon Verburg,</hi> and Captain <hi>Ooms.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Beauford</hi> Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the King his Maſter, to enter the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and join the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly appearing upon the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> he put them in alarm, and made a deſcent in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, and carried off a few ſheep, and ſome other ſmall Booty, which was all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he did the <hi>Hollanders</hi> whom he never join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the harm he did the <hi>English,</hi> whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea fought, ſave only that by ſculking about, and keeping the Enemy in fears however that he would join the <hi>Dutch</hi> he cauſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to divide their Force and ſend a part after him where he was not to be found, and ſo gave op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to batter and diſtreſs the other part, with their whole Force, and to obtain ſuch an advantage over the <hi>English,</hi> as they could never do when their Forces were United.

            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> both, in ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an occaſion, had great need of Seamen, to perfect the Compliments of their ſhips; which obliged the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to conſent to the Exchange of Priſoners, man for man, which they would never be perſwaded to do before, by all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Sollicitations the <hi>Dutch</hi> could make for that effect.

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:29562:175"/> which they that got were delivered, and thoſe that met with Blanks remained in Captivity and Miſery.</p>
            <p>A little time after, <hi>viz.</hi> On the 1ſt. of May, War was likewiſe declared againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by ſound of Trumpet, at <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>

            <p>And on the 11th. of <hi>June</hi> the two Fleets met, and fought that celebrated Battle of 4 days, the memory of which ought to be preſerved to all poſterity, as well for the unexampled Bravery of the <hi>English</hi> tho' overpowered by Numbers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe divided in Force, as for the dear bought advantage of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in it, which yet was far from meriting the name of a Victory, tho' State policy required it ſhould be bragged of and proclaimed Abroad as one no leſs than of the moſt Abſolute ſort.

                     <head>A Letter written to the College of the Admiralty of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> by <hi>Hondius,</hi> Captain on board Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> and dated the 12th. of <hi>June</hi> New ſtile from <hi>Goree,</hi> whither the Ship <hi>Hollandia</hi> in which he was, was brought in after the fight.</head>
                     <p>ON the 11th. of <hi>June,</hi> at the break of day, being come to an Anchor to the North-Weſt-ward, and at 9 or 10 miles diſtance from <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend,</hi> our Advanced guards that were detach'd to go out to diſcover the Enemy, came back to the Fleet, and brought us word, that the <hi>English</hi> Navy was to the Windward of us; and a little after, we ſaw 10 of their ſcout-Ships, who as ſoon as they had viewed us tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, and ſteered back to the North-weſt-ward to rejoyn their Grand Fleets. The wind being turn'd to the South-Weſt, and South-Weſt and a Quarter to the Weſt, begun to grow high, and the Sea to ſwell. In the mean time, all was ready for giving the <hi>English</hi> battle, and our Ships faced thoſe of the Enemy that were to the Wind-ward. After noon, we perceived the Enemies Fleet conſiſting of about 70 men of War, making directly towards us. At that time, we were, as I have ſaid, ſtill at Anchor; and becauſe the Wind was high and the Sea was ſomewhat rough, we thought the <hi>English</hi> had the Weather-gage, and would likewiſe come and caſt Anchor, but they inſtead of that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had faced our Fleet a while, fell to rights upon us; which hapning whilſt we were buſy in unmooring, and had our Anchors yet but half up, we were forced to cut our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in all haſte, becauſe the Enemy was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come within Cannon ſhot of us. without loſing time then we hoiſted our Main-Sails and ſaluted the Vice Admiral of the White, who was on our right hand, with ſome Guns; and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:29562:176"/> then the Enemy begun to fire likewiſe, they which were neareſt us anſwering us each of them with a broad ſide. Our Fleet, but eſpecially the Squadrons of the Lieutenant Admirals, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertſz</hi> and <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries,</hi> which according to the Order given were to have been to the Wind-ward, were fallen to Leeward, and were the hindermoſt of all the Fleet: But a little while after, upon a Signal we made to them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us in their due rank, they advanced in good Order. The <hi>English</hi> Admiral putting up a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Flag, attack'd us behind; but he was ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly charged by the Ships that followed us, that he was forced to tack about to the North-ward, which made him with ſome of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, fall into our Fleet, which cauſed a great deal of diſorder in the <hi>English</hi> Fleet. A Fiery Bullet from the Enemies ſet fire to the Right ſide of our Gallery, which we had much ado to quench. The Vice Admiral of the Red, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that the aboveſaid Admiral that carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Royal or Union Flag, whoſe Main maſt was ſhot down, had tackt about, would fain have followed him; but being already very much ſhattered, it was impoſſible for him to do it. The Vice Admiral of the White having followed the motion we made to the South-ward, was about the diſtance of a Musket ſhot from us, who being attackt by <hi>Solomonſz</hi> and <hi>de Haan,</hi> was extreamly endamaged: For his main ſail was ſhot to pieces, ſo that ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſuch a pitifull condition he fired ſome Guns without Bullet, to advertize his followers to come in to his Aſſiſtance; but they making as if they heard him not, betook themſelves to flight, and left him in the danger. And then we thought we might conveniently grapple him in Order to board him; But Captain <hi>Solomonſz</hi> Ship falling foul juſt in that nick, upon ours, we were entangled for ſome time together, but
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:29562:176"/> however ſoon after we got free of one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out damage. In the mean time the aforeſaid <hi>English</hi> Vice-Admiral, making uſe of that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, was fled away, in Company with ſome other <hi>English</hi> Ships; which being purſued by ours, were taken; And the Vice-Admiral of the White was forced to ſurrender himſelf to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Adrianſz</hi> who had grappled him. During all the time of the fight, we vigorouſly charged the <hi>English</hi> Navy together with our whole Fleet, till at laſt our maſts were ſhot cloſe by the Board, and our Mizzen and Fore-Maſts tumbled into the Sea; ſo that our Ship being quite diſabled and out of a condition to make any more Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> leapt into a Galliot, to go on board ſome other Ship, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to his Officers, that they would take care to ſave the Hull of his Ship by carrying it into the firſt Harbour they met with, we were brought in hither to day by the <hi>Aſperen</hi> Frigat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>SInce my laſt of the 10th. of this Month, we had a Calm all night, and on the 11th. in the morning, the Wind riſing higher, turned to the South-Weſt, which induced us to haſten to go and Anchor between <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and the North of theſe Provinces. About 9 a Clock our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced guards gave us notice by the appointed ſignal, that they had diſcovered the Enemies Fleet. At 10 a Clock the mizzen-maſt and Bolt-ſprit of Colonel <hi>de Gent</hi>'s Ship being blown into the Sea by the violence of the Wind, we Ordered him to retire into the firſt ſecure Harbour. At 11 we diſcovered the <hi>English</hi> Fleet making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us whoſe Admiral carried on his Main-maſt top the Union Flag of <hi>England,</hi> and the Red Flag on his Mizzen-maſt top, and upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a ſignal he ſometimes put up a third upon his Poop, without any blew in it. The Lieutenant Admiral carried a White Flag on his Main-maſt, without any blew. There were 3 Vice-Admirals, and Rear-Admirals that carried White and Blew Flags. The whole Number of the Ships that compoſed their Fleet was 70 ſail great and ſmall. We expected their charge at Anchor, becauſe the Wind was ſo high and the Sea ſo rough that we could not poſſibly weigh; ſo that when the <hi>English</hi> came within Cannon ſhot of us, we cut our Cables, by which means we loſt each of us an Anchor, and one or two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:29562:177"/> About noon, the fight begun by the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> and <hi>Van Meppelen,</hi> who were the foremoſt advanced on my left hand. The <hi>English</hi> had the Weather-gage, and we were to Leeward, which gave us the more advantage to fire our lower tires of Guns: After we had fought in that manner about three hours, with almoſt equal loſs on both ſides, the <hi>English</hi> tackt about to the North-ward; and then the Vice-Admiral of the White, and two or three other <hi>English</hi> Ships were ſeparated from the body of their Fleet, they being ſo much ſhattered, that they were not able to follow them; ſo that the Captains, <hi>Vander Zaan, Adrianſz,</hi> and <hi>Van Amſtel</hi> purſuing them cloſe, took them. Theſe are all the particulars I know. About that time Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Ship having loſt her Maſts, I found by the hoiſting of his Flag on board a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Ship, that he had been obliged to change his Ship. I perceived likewiſe, that a Ship of my Squadron, Commanded by Captain <hi>Otho Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long</hi> in which were the Prince of <hi>Monaco,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> with their retinue as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, was all on fire cauſed by ſome ſtopples; upon which, thoſe Lords fearing the fire might get to the powder-room, and blow up the Ship retired on Board my Son-in-Law <hi>John Gelders</hi> Ship, from whence they came on board me on the 12 in the morning.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>English</hi> having as we have ſaid, tackt about to the North-ward, Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> and <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries</hi> went on and charged them again, whilſt we were repairing our damages. And the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies finding themſelves to the Wind-ward of ſome of our Ships, the <hi>English</hi> Admiral General followed by ſeveral of his Ships, and ſome of the General Officers of his Navy, came to an Anchor, thinking to rally his Squadrons, and to ſtop the holes of ſuch of his Ships as had been pierced with Bullets. But when he ſaw us make
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:29562:178"/> a tack towards him, he cut his Cables and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards us with much Reſolution. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him as we ought, and having intercepted their Rear Admiral of the White, I ſent up my Fire Ship to burn him; but they ſhoved her off with Oars and Iron Leavers as they did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe another Fire-Ship of <hi>Zealand;</hi> however, near 200 of his Men, for fear of the flames, leapt into the Sea, and Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> kept cloſe to him till the laſt ſhot he fired. In fine that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Rear-Admirals ſhip, called the <hi>Injury</hi> ſunk, but we know not whether any of the reſt of the men that ſtaid on board her, were ſaved or no. She carried 54 Braſs, and 20 Iron Guns, and 400 Men. The night parted the Fray, and we paſſed it in repairing our Ships, charging our Cartridges, and caſting out all incumbrances.</p>
                  <p>On the 12th. at break of day, the <hi>English</hi> having the Weather-gage came powring upon us again. The fight was furious and bloody, and the two Fleets having broken through one another twice, at the third time, Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> and Vice Admiral <hi>Vander Hulſt,</hi> and ſome other ſhips of their Squadron, fell into the main body of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> where they fought moſt deſperately. I ſeeing the danger they were in, put a Red Flag for a ſignal, to the whole <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and Fall upon the Enemy; which was put in Execution. Our Ships were extreamly endamaged by the ſtout reſiſtance the <hi>English</hi> made. Captain <hi>Solomonſz</hi>'s Ship being faſtned upon by an <hi>English</hi> Fire-ſhip, was blown up, but moſt of his men were ſaved; and the ſhips of Vice Admiral <hi>Vander Hulſt,</hi> and Captain <hi>de Haan</hi> being both diſabled were forced to retire into the next Harbour. In the mean while the two Fleets broke through one another twice more and the laſt time my main Top-maſt and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Flag were ſhot down. Afternoon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies betook themſelves to flight, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:29562:178"/> continued all night, they Retreating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Thames.</hi> On the 13th. of the ſame month, being re-inforced with a Squadron, of 20 light Frigats, amongſt which were 3 or 4 great ſhips, they renewed the fight, but the night parted us. The Admiral's Ship of the White, being ready to ſink, we burnt her. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Ayſchew</hi> and his men were ſaved by one of our Ships. This morning having called on board the Admirals Ship, all the Captains of the Fleet we have reſolved to purſue the Victory, in hopes that God will bleſs our Arms with a Compleat one. I cannot yet be informed of the particulars of our Loſſes, any more than of thoſe of the Enemies. But I know very well, that whilſt we purſued them, we could ſcarcely count — or 40 of their Ships together before they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Reinforcement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>I Shall inform your Noble Mightineſſes of the moſt Remarkable Circumſtances that are come to my knowledge of the Battle, lately fought between the two Fleets. On the 11th. Inſtant, at noon, we were riding at an Anchor near <hi>Newport,</hi> when the Wind being grown high, and the Sea rough, the <hi>English</hi> Navy conſiſting of about 58 ſail came from the Weſt-ward, and fell upon us. It was Commanded in chief by Admiral <hi>Monk.</hi> Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Squadron was poſted to the South-Weſt-ward, that of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> in the main Battle, and that of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> extended towards
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:29562:179"/> the North-Eaſt. The Enemies begun their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, who was obliged to cut his Anchor-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and to bear the greateſt brunt of their aſſailing Arms. His Maſts being ſhot down were tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the Sea by the violence of the Wind. <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Squadron thereupon begun to give way, and to make back towards the main Body of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, and then <hi>de Ruiter</hi> advanced to ſupport them, accompanied with ſome other ſhips. 'Tis true? The <hi>Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſh</hi> had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Wind, but it being violent, their Ships being by it heav'd all on one ſide had much ado to play their Guns with any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, whereas we with our lower Tires fired up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with no ſmall effect. At the beginning of the night, we had already diſperſed a part of their Fleet. In which their Vice Admiral of the White was taken by a Ship of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and the Rear Admiral of the ſame Squadron run in great danger of being burnt to Aſhes by three Fire-ſhips, which yet wrought not the effect expected from them: For having carried their Flames no further than his Poop, they were quencht, and the Fire-ſhips repulſed; ſo that the ſhip eſcaped by favour of the night, tacking away to the Eaſtward; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a good part of her Seamen ſeeing her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger leapt into the Sea, chooſing rather to periſh in the Water than to be burnt. There is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that ſhip ſo ſhattered as ſhe was ſunk ſoon after, becauſe ſhe was never heard of ſince. During the obſcurity of the Night, the diſperſed ſhips of the Enemies got together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and we made a task to the South-Ward. On <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, we perceived the <hi>Engliſh</hi> behind us, and made up to them, but they without waiting for us, advanced to meet us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Reſolution and Courage. And then the two Fleets broke through one another tho' a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:29562:179"/> the continual Fire of each others Guns. A Calm came on, and after that, the Wind turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the South, of which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the advantage. Our Admiral having broke through the Enemies Fleet, got the Weather-gage of them, ſo that he prevailed with the greateſt part of his Forces over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, excepting only <hi>Tromp,</hi> who with 7 or 8 Ships of his Squadron was to Leeward. He had changed his Ship, and was then in that called, <hi>the Province of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht;</hi> he was very ill handled, as was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his Vice Admiral, and had like to have been reduced to Aſhes by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fire-ſhip. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> conſidering the danger in which <hi>Tromp</hi> was, reſolved to diſ-engage him, and for that effect, he ordered the greateſt part of his Fleet to make a tack to the South-ward, whilſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Rear fell upon the Enemies main body, making directly towards <hi>Tromp,</hi> to aſſiſt him: The <hi>English</hi> ſeeing him come, opened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Admiral of the White advanced at the head of his Squadron, followed by two Fire-ſhips, to ſtop <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> who obſerving the motion the Enemies had newly made, tackt to the South-ward, to rejoin, if poſſible, the reſt of his Fleet, which was tackt about to the North-ward, with the ſame intention, ſo that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> contented themſelves with firing upon him at a diſtance with their Guns, without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to follow him. But methinks committed then a ſtrange fault. For it had been eaſy for them to have deſtroyed the few Ships <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had with him, and <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Squadron was able to make no more Reſiſtance againſt them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in ſpite of their Cannonadings, the intended Junction was effected. The matter paſſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the ſame manner, as it did the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for by the motion we made, two <hi>English</hi> ſhips were ſeparated from the reſt, whereof one was ſunk, to which I my ſelf, without bragging
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:29562:180"/> contributed the moſt, and the other was ſo ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> that the Enemies finding her no longer able to keep the Sea, ſet fire to her. In the mean while, the two Fleets being got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again, the fight was renewed, and we engaged together three times more, firing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually at one another till the dusk of the evening. And then the <hi>English</hi> loſing Courage, did not think fit to charge us any more, but tackt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the Eaſt-ward, in the mean while we chaced them as far as the Calm Weather, and the approach of the night would permit us. On <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, the Wind was fair, and the Wind turned to the Eaſt, and we purſued the <hi>English</hi> again till 4 a Clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, the moſt part of which retreated towards the Weſt-South-Weſt, in pretty good order; And then they were reinforced, by Prince <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> s Squadron conſiſting of 20 Men of War, coming from the South-ward. In the mean time whilſt we were chacing them Sir <hi>George Ayſchew</hi>'s Ship Admiral of the White Squadron, call'd the <hi>Royal Prince,</hi> carrying 92 Guns, was ſtranded at the mouth of the <hi>Thames</hi> and yielded to Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> without firing ſo much as a Gun, which after we had taken out of her, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and his men we burnt. On <hi>Monday</hi> the 14th. in the morning, the <hi>English</hi> having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Reinforcement of a freſh Squadron, took new Courage, and came and attackt us again. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> thereupon having ſummoned all his Captains on board the Admiral Ship, Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them their duty and the honour of their Country, after which we renewed the fight again, and having the Weather-gage we reſolved to break through the Enemies Fleet, and by that means, quickly to put them to the Rout. But the <hi>English</hi> Received us with much Reſolution and Bravery, and it may be ſaid, that there and then it was, that the Valour of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:29562:180"/> all in General, and of every one in particular was ſeen to appear in its full Luſtre. After the Fight, had been vigorouſly maintained till 4 a Clock, our Fleet was divided into two Parts: For <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> at the Head of one of them, made a Motion above the Enemies Fleet, whilſt the other had order to keep below them, with Deſign to encloſe them. We had ſcarce paſt by the half of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, but we fell upon them, and broke through them, from the one end to the other, with ſo much Fury that they were preſently put to the Rout. And then it was, there was a ſad Spectacle to be ſeen of dead and wounded men, and a terrible har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of Maſts mown down, and of Sails, and all ſorts of tackle tumbled into the Sea, as well on the one ſide as the other. About 6 in the Evening the Enemies betook themſelves wholly to flight, and we gave them chace. Being advanced near Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> we boarded one of the Enemies Ships, called the <hi>Havertuin,</hi> carrying 56 Guns, which yielded in ſight of Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> he not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to come to her Aſſiſtance, but contented himſelf with killing me one Seaman, and ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Arm of another. And beſides the ſhip I took the ſame evening there were 4 more ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in my ſight. In the mean while the whole <hi>English</hi> Fleet was entirely diſperſed, and every one of them ſought to ſave themſelves by a nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble retreat! the Sea was covered with wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Veſſels, the moſt of them ſteering Weſtward. Admiral <hi>Monk,</hi> and an <hi>English</hi> Rear Admiral loſt their main Maſts, ſo that I doubt not but they will fall to day into our hands; and ſo much the rather, that every one of them minding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their own preſervation before that of any one elſe, they were ſeen to ſcamper about with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation without taking any care what deſtiny befell the reſt. In fine, we have all the reaſon in the World, to thank God for the ſignal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory we have newly obtained, and for having

            <p>Theſe Letters, how Authentick ſoever they were, met with no credit in <hi>England:</hi> And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it was noiſed throughout all the Kingdom that they had defeated the Enemies Fleet, and chaced the <hi>Hollanders</hi> as far as into the very Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of <hi>Zealand;</hi> Nay, that they had miſt but little of taking Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Ship, (as indeed they had, had they minded their buſineſs, and <hi>Tromp</hi> too;) that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had loſt in that fight, 40 Ships, and at leaſt 6000 men; whereas the loſs of the <hi>English</hi> was reduced to but 4 men of War, 3 Captains, ſome few Seamen or Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers killed, and about 300 wounded; that their Fleet was but very little endamaged, and would be fit to put to Sea again in 15 days at furtheſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The people of <hi>Brabant, Cologne,</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> were credulous enough to believe all thoſe falſe reports; But in a little time after; they found by experience the vanity of thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boaſts by the great number of the dead and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of which all the Harbours of Great <hi>Britain</hi> were full.

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:29562:181"/> and that the <hi>English</hi> proceeded ſo far as to publiſh a Relation Printed by Authority, of which the whole deſign was, to prepoſſeſs peoples minds with an opinion, that they had had the advantage.

                  <p>THe <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet having ſpent from the 1 of <hi>June</hi> to the 5th of the ſame month of the year 1666, in getting out of the <hi>Texel</hi> by reaſon of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:29562:182"/> ſeveral croſs Winds and Calms that hindred them, it was impoſſible for them becauſe of contrary Winds, to purſue their deſigned Courſe, and to go towards the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> according to the Orders they had received for that purpoſe, before the 8th. of the Month. On the 11th. in the morning, they with much ado got as far as 7 or 8 miles to the Eaſt-South-Eaſt-ward of the North <hi>Foreland,</hi> which is a part of <hi>England</hi> that extends between the Channel and the <hi>Thames</hi> whereby a South Weſt wind that blew very fiercely they were forced to Anchor. The <hi>English</hi> Fleet being come ſome days before to Anchor in the <hi>Downs,</hi> unmoor'd from thence on the 11th. of <hi>June,</hi> probably upon the advice they had heard of the approach of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet. And about noon, the two Fleets met. That of <hi>Holland</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of 83 men of War, or Frigats, beſides Advice-Boats, Fire-ſhips, and other ſmall Tenders on the Fleet. But it hapned, that about an hour before the Battle, one of the moſt conſiderable Ships of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, commanded by Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>de Gent</hi> having unfortunately loſt her Fore-maſt, and afterwards her mizzen maſt by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Wind, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> Judging her in that condition uncapable to fight, ſent her out of the Fleet in ſight of the Enemies, to retire into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The ſaid <hi>de Gent</hi> removed after that into the Ship of Captain <hi>Henry Gotskens.</hi> As for the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, they were 80 ſail ſtrong as they were counted by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> at the very time of fight. About 1 a Clock afternoon, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to play their Guns. Some moments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> had cut their Anchor-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to make the more haſte, and to Accommodate themſelves to the ſeaſon, and the violence of the Waves which would not permit them to weigh: The two Fleets being then met, they both of them made a tack to the South ward, the Wind
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:29562:182"/> being then turned Weſt-South-Weſt. That mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the cauſe that Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> and <hi>Van Meppelen,</hi> who were before placed in the Rear, found themſelves in the Van, and were forced to bear the brunt of the moſt furious and terrible ſhock that hapned during the whole fight, which they did moſt valiantly. The fight being thus begun, the Squadron of Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes,</hi> followed by their other Officers, fell thundering upon the Enemies with an undauntedneſs, without Example. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while after, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frigat of the Blue Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, carrying 50 Guns, ſunk, after ſhe had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Farewell Broadſide from <hi>de Ruiter.</hi> The Squadron of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Cornelius Evertſz</hi> and <hi>Tierk Hiddes de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries</hi> had all the difficulty in the World, to get to engage at firſt, becauſe they were to Leeward, and at a pretty diſtance from the Enemies. In the mean while, the two Fleets char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged one another vigorouſly, making always the ſame motion, which laſted till 5 a Clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; when the <hi>English</hi> tacked to the North-weſtward, as well to keep the Weather-gage, as to avoid the ſand Banks of <hi>Flanders.</hi> That motion engaged the Squadron of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertſz</hi> and <hi>Tierk Hiddes de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries</hi> in a Bloody Fight, in which the undaunted Valour and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of thoſe two Generals were ſeen to ſhine with equal Luſter. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> being thus tackt about, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet found means thereby to intercept ſome of their biggeſt Ships which were preſently boarded and taken by 3 <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War, and afterwards carried into <hi>Holland.</hi> One of them called the <hi>Swiftſure</hi> carried 70 Guns, moſt of them Braſs, Commanded by <hi>Barkley,</hi> Vice-Admiral of the White Squadron, who loſt his life there after he had Signalized himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Captain <hi>Henry Adria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:29562:183"/> of 60 Guns, was taken by Captain <hi>Vander Zaan</hi>'s Frigat which carried 52 Guns; and the Third, called the Loyal <hi>George,</hi> of 44 Guns, fell into the hands of Captain <hi>Andrew Swart,</hi> whoſe Ship called the <hi>Deventer,</hi> carried 66 Guns: All thoſe Captains belonged to the Admiralty of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> And on the contrary, in the firſt attack, there were two <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships burnt, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Duiven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voorde</hi> of 46 Guns, and Commanded by <hi>Otto Van Treſlong;</hi> the ſecond called, <hi>The Court of Zealand,</hi> had on board 58 Guns, and was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captain <hi>Blok.</hi> We are informed aſſuredly, that theſe two Ships were unhappily burnt to Aſhes by ſome ſtopples blown back on board by the force of the Wind, juſt at the time that their own Guns were diſcharging. The Prince of <hi>Monaco,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> were Volunteers on board the firſt of theſe, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily eſcaped the danger of the Flames, by Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nimbly into the Ship, called the <hi>Little Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Commanded by <hi>Cornelius Evertſz Van Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> Son-in-Law to Admiral <hi>Ruiter,</hi> who receiv'd them afterwards on board his own Ship. In the firſt attack, the Sails, Maſts, and in General all the Tackle of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Ship, were ſo endamaged, that another Ship falling foul on him in paſſing by, all his Maſts were tumbled thereby into the Sea. Rear Admiral <hi>Van Nes</hi>'s Ship came off at a not much better rate, ſince almoſt at the ſame time his Mizzen-Maſt was ſhot by the board. Upon which thoſe two General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were forced to remove into other Ships for the ſecurity of their Perſons. In which as ſoon as they had put up their Flags they were ſeen again to renew the Fight, and to Signalize themſelves. Their unmaſted Ships being carried out of the Fray, were towed away into <hi>Holland.</hi> The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Fleet having advanced above the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> their Chief Admiral followed by ſome Ships of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:29562:183"/> his Squadron, caſt Anchor; but a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſeeing <hi>de Ruiter</hi> coming towards him, at the head of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, he cut his Cables at his approach, ſo that they engaged again afreſh, and the fight was furious and very bloody on that occaſion, and yet, God be thanked, without the loſs of any of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships; whereas about 7 or 8 a Clock in the evening, a great <hi>English</hi> Ship of the Blew Squadron carrying between 60 and 70 Guns, ſunk within Musket ſhot of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>de Ruiter.</hi> The two aforeſaid <hi>English</hi> Ships ſinking in the view of the Officers and Sea men of the whole <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, I think there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of it. It's true we are not ſure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any other <hi>English</hi> Ship periſhed that day, but at the beginning of the night, the Rear-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of the White, whoſe Ship was a firſt Rate, having been vigorouſly attackt by <hi>De Ruiter,</hi> and ſome other Ships of his Squadron, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready very much ſhattered, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> ſent out a Fire Ship from his Squadron, which faſtned upon her and ſet her on fire, but the firſt Fire-Ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put off, ſunk, and the flames in the ſaid Rear Admirals were quencht? Then another Fire-Ship of the <hi>Zealand</hi> Squadron was ſent to burn her; and ſet the <hi>English</hi> Ship again in Flames, but that was likewiſe Repulſed, and the fire quencht. A third Fire-Ship under the Covert of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi>'s Guns was once more ſent to Try to repair the ill ſucceſs of the others, but was not a whit luckier than they, for faſtning upon the <hi>English</hi> Rear Admiral, he ſet Fire to him indeed, but a moment after, that was quencht, and the Fire Ship was ſunk with Cannon ſhot, ſo that according to the Teſtimony of all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers which were preſent, and were ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatours of that Glorious Action, the undaunted Bravery of that <hi>English</hi> Rear-Admiral cannot but be Admired, which was ſo much the more Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe ſome of his men having ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:29562:184"/> by ſwiming, and got on board a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship, aſſured us, that near 300 of his men leapt into the Sea, at the approach of the two firſt Fire-ſhips, chooſing rather to periſh by Water than by Fire. The ſame Rear-Admiral performed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at the end of the fight, an Action Glorious to him, but fatal to us, by a Cannon ſhot, that took away the life of the Illuſtrious <hi>Cornelius Evertſz</hi> Lieutenant Admiral, whoſe good Conduct and great Courage had made him to be Admired not only in that fight, but in many other rencounters beſides. The night then parted the Combatants, it being impoſſible for us to ſee, by reaſon of the darkneſs, or the thick ſmoak, whether the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Rear-Admiral, being ſhrewdly battered ſcap'd away and ſaved himſelf, or whether he ſunk to the bottom of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>When the night was paſt, the <hi>English</hi> Fleet found it ſelf on the 12th. of <hi>June</hi> at break of day, having the Weather-gage, about half a mile off of that of <hi>Holland,</hi> the Wind at Weſt-South-Weſt. The two Fleets made a motion, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> towards the North-Weſt, and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> toward the South, with deſign to follow one the other; But the <hi>English</hi> having the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Wind, diſputed their Enemies paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and without waiting any longer, advanced to them, and fell upon them. The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> without changing their Courſe or their Countenance, ſtood firm in Luffing, ſo that the two Hoſtile Fleets broke through one another and began a moſt furious fight; yet there was not ſo much as one <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship that was ſo unfortunate as to be loſt in it, according to the Teſtimony of all the Officers, both General and Inferiour of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, given in to the ſaid Deputies and Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries of the States. The Fleets then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broke in upon one another in that manner, their Guns made ſtrange Havock: For the moſt part of the Ships of the two Fleets had their Maſts,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:29562:184"/> their Sails and Tackling either ſhot away, or ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to pieces. And as each party was endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all ſpeed to repair their damages, there hapned a Calm, which produced a Ceſſation of Arms, ſo that the two Fleets floated about in preſence of one another, till about 11 a Clock before noon, and then the wind riſing, they charged again, and renewed the Engagement more hotly than ever. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> had then the Weather-gage, <hi>De Ruiter</hi> having penetrated to the very center of the Enemies Fleet, heard a moſt horrid noiſe of both great Guns and Muskets which made him believe, that ſome of his Ships being ſurrounded by the Enemies, were making their laſt efforts, and were in danger of being loſt without ſpeedy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, ſo that without any longer heſitation, he advanced with his Squadron, and falling upon that part of them, he forced a paſſage through the Storms of the Enemies ſhot and fire, and found Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> whoſe Flag was then hoiſted in <hi>de Swart</hi>'s Ship, in the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, but yet fighting with all imaginable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity, as likewiſe did Vice Admiral <hi>Vander Hulſt,</hi> and the Captains, <hi>Solomonſz, de Haan,</hi> and <hi>Van Amſtel,</hi> their Ships being ſurrounded and battered on all ſides by the <hi>English,</hi> were able to hold out no longer, and were at the point of being burnt or ſunk, without the aſſiſtance of <hi>de Ruiter.</hi> At his approach, Captain <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſz</hi>'s Ship was already all on fire, which 'twas impoſſible to Quench. That Captain and a good part of his men had very much ado to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on board another <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship. <hi>Solomonſz</hi> as ſoon as he was got out of that danger, went on board Captain <hi>Schey</hi>'s Ship, where after he had further Signalized his Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and given great Proofs of his Courage, during the whole time of the fight, he died at laſt in the bed of Honour.

                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:29562:186"/> likewiſe the Ships of all the three other Captains abovenamed, were reduced into ſo pitifull a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by the loſs of all their Maſts, that Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> was again obliged to change Ship, and thoſe which were Commanded by Vice-Admiral <hi>Vander Hulſt,</hi> and the Captains <hi>de Haan Swart</hi> and <hi>Van Amſtel,</hi> being quite diſabled for fight, had Order to go out of the fight and ſeek ſhelter in the firſt Harbour they came to. In the ſame ſhock, Vice Admiral <hi>Vander Hulſt</hi> was killed with a Cannon ſhot, being extreamly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greted becauſe of his great Merit, Experience, and Bravery. But God be thanked thoſe loſſes were doubly Recompenced the ſame day by the great number of <hi>English</hi> Ships that were burnt or ſunk according to the following Order, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A Ship of the Red Squadron carrying near 60 Guns was ſunk in the Van guard of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, about noon. 2. A Ship of the blew Squadron, carrying between 50 and 60 Guns, ſunk at three in the afternoon, preſently after <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had thundred at her in paſſing. 3. A Ship of the White Squadron carrying near 50 Guns, ſunk a little after, by the ſide of Vice Admiral <hi>de Liefde,</hi> who ſhot her through and through in ſo many places that ſhe rowled on one ſide, and was ſwallowed up by the Waves. 4. Another Ship of the White Squadron carrying 50 Guns, ſunk half an hour after, in ſight of <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Squadron, and of Captain <hi>Van Meeuwen</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her cloſe, and gave her a Broadſide in paſſing. And abſolutely to convince the World, that the two aboveſaid Ships of the White Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron were two different Ships, it is to be obſerv d that ſeveral Officers and other Sea-faring men ſaw both of them ſink, that is to ſay, that the ſame perſons that ſaw one periſh, ſaw the other under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the ſame fare a little after; for we have ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtinguiſht things in our Examination, that there is no reaſon to fear, we have miſtaken a
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:29562:186"/> Ships for one. 5. The Ship called, the <hi>Golden Eagle,</hi> or the Arms of <hi>Groningen,</hi> taken the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn</hi> before by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> when the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was diſperſed by a Tempeſt, was ſunk by a broad ſide from Captain <hi>Marreveld.</hi> 6. Another <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Ship ſunk in the midſt of their own Fleet, after ſhe had in vain ſignifyed her danger to her Companions, without receiving any aſſiſtance from them.</p>
                  <p>In the fight of the two firſt days, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in that of the fourth, of which we ſhall ſpeak more largely afterwards, it is certain, that 'tis not to be doubted, that ſome <hi>English</hi> Ships were burnt, which yet we could not be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely aſſured of, becauſe fire being ſet to ſeveral Fire-Ships at divers times, we cannot poſitively ſay whether the Ships they grapled were deſtroyed, or whether they eſcaped, except only two that we are ſure were burnt to Aſhes during the fight, becauſe the Officers and Seamen that ſerved on board the ſaid Fire-Ships are now actually ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting for the reward allotted by the States for ſuch Service, by producing good Certificates of their performance of it: Beſides, that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> priſoners drawn out of the Waves, and ſent into the reſpective Colleges of the Admiralty, are able to anſwer if carefully examined, and to tell out of what Ships they eſcaped. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that by that means, it will be found, that a greater Number of <hi>English</hi> Ships than we know of, were burnt or ſunk.</p>
                  <p>The fight of the 12th. of <hi>June</hi> was terrible and Bloody, eſpecially afternoon, ſo that there were few Ships of either Fleet but ſufficiently felt the effects of it by the loſs of their Maſts, Round-Tops, Top-Maſts, Sails, and Rigging: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, the Top-maſt and Admirals Flag of <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Ship was ſhot away, about 3 or 4 a Clock, which obliged him to give Order to Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes,</hi> till ſuch time as
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:29562:187"/> he could repair it, to put the Admirals Flag on board his Ship, and to Command in Chief in his abſence, according to the Orders before given: Which he did with ſo much Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that after the two Fleets had broke through one another three times, as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were ready to fall on the fourth time, the <hi>English</hi> tackt about and made with all the ſail they could for their own Coaſts. Their Fleet was then weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the loſs of 8 or 9 men of War. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſeeing them flie made all the ſail they could, to purſue them; But their flight was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the obſcurity of the night, and the Calms that then begun to come on, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to veer back towards their own Admiral again.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> having Repaired his damages, put up the Admiral's Flag again, and re-aſſumed the chief Command of the Fleet on the 13th of <hi>June.</hi> But the <hi>English</hi> diſcovering at break of day, the miſchiefs that the obſcurity of the night had hidden from them, and ſeeing a good Number of their Ships much ſhattered, thought fit to burn them, to prevent the purſuit of their Enemies and prevent their falling into their hands. After which they did their beſt to get into the <hi>Thames.</hi> The Wind was at Eaſt, and then turning to the Eaſt-South-Eaſt, grew ſo weak that they were forced to crowd all the ſail they could. It was impoſſible for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to know juſtly how many Ships the <hi>English</hi> had burnt. But the <hi>English</hi> in their publick News of the 17th of <hi>June,</hi> Printed at <hi>London</hi> by Authority, made loud claim to the Victory, and pretended they burnt but three by order of the Admiral, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and two other leſſer Ships. The <hi>English</hi> continuing thus their retreat all the day came at laſt ſo very near the Sand-banks that are at the mouth of the River, that <hi>Sir George Ayſchew,</hi> Admiral of the White Squadron, who
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:29562:187"/> was in the <hi>Royal Prince</hi> carrying 90 Braſs Guns, one of the moſt conſiderable Ships of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Fleet, run a ground upon the bank called, the <hi>Galloper,</hi> which was a great misfortune for a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral who had given ſignal proofs of his Courage all the whole time of the fight, and who was then retiring only by order of his Admiral: And 'tis a very aſtoniſhing thing that after he had fired ſeveral Guns to give notice to the reſt of the Ships of the Fleet to advance to his aſſiſtance, yet no body would offer to come nigh him, but he was thus deſerted and left expoſed to danger even by the Ships of his own Squadron. Being in that pitiful condition, he ſaw himſelf juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be burnt by the approach of two <hi>Dutch</hi> Fire-ſhips, if Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> who was then in the Ship of Rear Admiral <hi>Sweers,</hi> had not given a ſignal to Command the Fire-Ships to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further, ſo much the rather becauſe by putting up a Flag on board him, in the manner u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual on ſuch occaſions, he ſhewed marks of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and demanded Quarter, upon which the Seamen of Rear-Admiral <hi>Sweers</hi> Ship, had Order from Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> to go on board Admiral <hi>Ayſchew,</hi> which they did accordingly. And Admiral <hi>Ayſchew,</hi> and ſome of his Officers were Conducted on board Rear Admiral <hi>Sweers,</hi> and the next day being put into a Galliot, he was conveyed to the <hi>Hague,</hi> by order of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>de Ruiter.</hi> As for his Ship, the <hi>Prince Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> tho' ſhe was afterwards got off of the Bank, yet becauſe ſhe was ſo extreamly ſhattered that <hi>de Ruiter</hi> thought her not in a condition to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to follow the main body of the Fleet, he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to be burnt; which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put in execution, after they had taken out the men. Near about the ſame time towards evening a Squadron of 22 <hi>English</hi> Men of War appeared towards the Weſt, under the Command of Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> who according to the advices we
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:29562:188"/> had of him, was detached away the Day before, to ſail towards the Harbours of <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> in order to joyn ſome other Men of War, and to go meet the Duke of <hi>Beauford,</hi> Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> and to fight him. Three other great <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Ships that were come out of the <hi>Thames</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe joyned him, which altogether made a Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of 25 Men of War. At the Sight and Approach of that Succour, the Squadron of <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Frieſland</hi> advanced to fight them; but Prince <hi>Robert</hi> avoided them, and tackt away to joyn the Body of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, ſo that he joyned them accordingly about the Dusk of Night. And then the Enemies Fleet was compoſed of 60 Men of War, of which the moſt part were freſh and in good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was ſtill 64 Men of War ſtrong, but having maintained already a Fight of 3 Days, both their Ships and Men had ſuffered very much, and their Forces were in a manner ſpent. As for the reſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, there were three of them burnt or ſunk, as has been already ſaid; the reſt were detached away, to conduct into <hi>Holland</hi> the Priſes taken from the Enemies, or thoſe of our Ships that were unmaſted and diſabled by them.</p>
                  <p>Things being in that State, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill at the Eve of another bloody Battle, made a Motion in the Night, in order to avoid the Banks, and get more Sea-room. When it was Day, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> fired ſeveral Guns to ſummon the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and Captains of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet on Board him, where he held a Council of War, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted every one of them in particular, to have in Recommendation his own Honour, and the Glory of his Country. So that after he had given them the neceſſary Orders, the Fight begun again on the 14th of <hi>June,</hi> at 8 in the Morning, and was fought between the <hi>Foreland,</hi> and the Banks of <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the open Sea, about 8 miles from the Shore. The Wind was South South Eaſt, ſo that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> having the Weather-gage, came powring with the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:29562:188"/> Three Squadrons of their Fleet upon the Enemies Navy, in three ſeveral Places, forcing a Paſſage through them, by which means ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships were ſeparated from the reſt. After which, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> cauſed a Motion to be made to the South-ward, with deſign to charge the Enemy again, who did the ſame on their Side; which was renewed three ſeveral times. Thus the two Fleets fought all the Day with much Obſtinacy, the Victory all the while ſeeming equally balanced, and not to know for which ſide to declare. In the Time of this cruel Fight, a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship commanded by Captain <hi>

                        </gap>,</hi> was burnt and ſunk. And an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fire-ſhip ſeeing the Ship of Vice-Admiral <hi>de Liefde</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſted, was going to grapple him, but was repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſaid Vice-Admiral, and chancing to fall foul upon another <hi>Dutch</hi> Fireſhip, they were both reduced to Aſhes. On the other ſide, one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fireſhips endeavoured alſo to faſten upon Prince <hi>Robert</hi>'s Ship, to burn her, but was grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled her ſelf by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fireſhip that kept by Prince <hi>Robert</hi>'s ſide, ſo that they were both burnt together with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship that chanced unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately to fall foul upon them, and all periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Flames. In the mean while, Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> with Rear Admiral <hi>Sweers</hi> Ship, which he was in, and ſome others of his Squadron, after he had maintained a long and furious Fight, found himſelf reduced into ſo pitiful a Condition, that he was forced to retire out of the Fray, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and repair his Damages, with Deſign to return again, as ſoon as was poſſible to the Charge. <hi>De Ruiter,</hi> tho' weakened by the Retreat of ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable Ships of his Fleet, which had been already diſabled, conſidering, that the Sun begun to decline, reſolved to make a laſt Effort, to force the Victory to declare it ſelf; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave the Signal to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to fail on on all ſides upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet. At which Signal the Lieutenant Admirals, <hi>van Meppelen</hi> and <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries,</hi>
                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:29562:189"/> as alſo the Vice-Admirals <hi>Bankert, Schram,</hi> and <hi>Koenders,</hi> and Rear-Admiral <hi>Bruinſveld</hi> broke in among the Enemies with all imaginable undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and it happened, that Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>Van Nes</hi> and Vice-Admiral <hi>de Liefde,</hi> with the Rear-Admirals <hi>Van Nes,</hi> and <hi>Evertſz,</hi> followed by ſeveral other Ships, finding themſelves below the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> with the reſt of the Fleet, above them, that part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet that was between them, was ſo furiouſly attack'd, as was likewiſe their whole Navy in general, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that in leſs than half an Hours Fight, they were put in Confuſion and begun to fly the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Time. On the one ſide were to be ſeen the <hi>White Squadron</hi> with 8 or 10 Men of War flying right before the Wind, and on the other, the Admirals of the <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>Blue</hi> making likewiſe full Sail, and doing what elſe they could, to advance their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat towards the <hi>English</hi> Coaſts. In the mean while, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships at <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Signal, took all the <hi>English</hi> Ships they came near enough to Board. Rear-Admiral <hi>Bruinſveld,</hi> having with much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution grappled two of the Enemies Frigats, took them, but afterwards, whether it were for want of Order, or by the Fault of thoſe that had the guarding of them, the <hi>English</hi> retook them again. Some time after, Captain <hi>Pauw</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Action, fell vigorouſly upon them again, and wreſted them once more out of the Hands of the <hi>English.</hi> But one of thoſe Frigats, called the <hi>Bull,</hi> was ſo ſhattered that ſhe, no longer able to keep the Sea, ſoon after ſunk. The other, called the <hi>Eſſex,</hi> carrying 58 Guns, and leſs endamaged, was carried into the <hi>Texel.</hi> A like Accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to another <hi>English</hi> Frigat, but ſhe was reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Enemies. Vice-Admiral <hi>Koenders</hi> took likewiſe at the ſame time a Ship called the <hi>Nagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boom,</hi> that was taken from the <hi>Dutch</hi> the Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, carrying 62 Guns, and ſent her into the <hi>Texel</hi> Captain <hi>Ruth Maximilian,</hi> took alſo the Ship call'd
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:29562:189"/> the <hi>Couvertyn</hi> of 54 Guns, and ſent her into <hi>Goree.</hi> Beſides them, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers pretend to know of two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships more that were ſunk the Day before, <hi>viz.</hi> one of the <hi>White Squadron,</hi> ſwallowed up by the Waves at 6 in the Evening, and a little while after the other met with the ſame Deſtiny; which makes us apt to think that ſeveral other <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Ships might have the ſame Fortune, tho' the <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers know nothing of it, the Enemies being in ſo deplorable a Condition, and purſued by the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> It ſeems, that God, after he had ſo gloriouſly favoured the Arms of the Victours, was not pleaſed they ſhould be utterly defeated by the Deſtruction of their whole Navy, which appeared as unavoidable: For the ſhattered Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of them miraculouſly eſcaped by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a thick Fog, about 7 a Clock at Night. However, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet being victorious and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, continued to chace them a long time after their being routed, and would have purſued them into their very Ports, if they had not been afraid their Ships would have loſt themſelves, and have been ſcattered. And therefore <hi>de Ruiter</hi> having fired ſome Guns for a Signal to advertiſe all the Ships of his Fleet to veer back towards their Admiral, and the whole <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet thereupon aſſembling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſailed away all Night leiſurely, and with little Sail homewards.</p>

Nine <hi>Holland</hi> Men of War, beſides that Commanded by Colonel <hi>de Gent,</hi> which were moſt endamaged, or who had Orders to guard home the Priſes taken from the <hi>English,</hi> were already arrived at <hi>Goree:</hi> Ten more had been ſent before at ſeveral Times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Errand to the <hi>Texel,</hi> which was the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:29562:190"/> Place of their Rendezvous. And the four others, as we have already related, were burnt or ſunk in the Fight, making in all, with a light Frigat of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> that had ſerved the Fleet as an Advice-Yacht, the number of 85 Men of War that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Fleet, beſides Fireſhips and Tenders, when it came out of the <hi>Texel:</hi> Whereas on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we hear, That the Remainder of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet retired in Diſorder into the neareſt Harbours, and the moſt of them into <hi>Harwich.</hi> To this let us add for concluſion, That the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> have all the reaſon in the World to thank God for bleſſing their Arms with ſo ſignal a Victory, ſince without counting in thoſe Ships of the Enemies that were burnt or ſunk, of which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers had no Knowledge, the <hi>English</hi> Fleet was weakened with the Loſs of 23 Men of War taken or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> among which, were an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral and a Vice-Admiral: Whereas on the ſide of the <hi>

            <p>This was the Relation publiſh'd by the States, of the memorable Battle of 4 Days, the Bloodieſt and moſt terrible one certainly that ever was fought at Sea. But the unexpected ſpeedy coming out of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet again in little above 6 Weeks after, with much greater Strength than before; and with ſeveral of thoſe Ships ſaid to have been loſt, took off very much from the Credit of the aboveſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, how Authentick ſoever it had appeared before. However, that dear-bought Advantage which they called a Victory, was ſo much the greater on the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſide; becauſe their Allies, the <hi>French,</hi> were not there to ſhare with them in it, but only decoying away a conſiderable part of the <hi>English</hi> Forces to hunt after them, where they were reſolved
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:29562:190"/> not to be found, had left the <hi>Dutch</hi> the fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, with their whole Force, to fall upon little more than half the <hi>English</hi> Royal Navy. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the fair Promiſes <hi>France</hi> had made, to joyn their Fleet to that of the States, and the mighty Hopes they had given them of their great Deſigns, they all vaniſht into Smoak, the <hi>French</hi> having no other Deſign at the Bottom, as has been already hinted, and has ſince more viſibly appeared, but to get their Ships built, to procure Men skilful in Naval Architecture, and to learn the way of Sea-Fight; which they effected firſt by ſtriking in with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and afterwards perfected by wheedling the King of <hi>England,</hi> which has proved ſince to the Smart of both Nations. In a Word, as to the Fighting Part, the <hi>French</hi> left the <hi>Dutch</hi> to cope alone with the Maritime Forces of <hi>England,</hi> as they did in a following War, the <hi>English</hi> to deal with thoſe of <hi>Holland,</hi> tho' to hinder <hi>England</hi> from putting forth its full Strength, they were pleaſed to appear with their Fleet to be Spectators of the Fray in which they were ſure to be Winners whoſoever loſt. But to return again to our direct Subject, it may be ſaid, That under God the undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and wiſe Conduct of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had the greateſt Share in what Advantage was gotten in that fierce Battle againſt the Potent and Warlike, who tho' outnumbred and overpowered, yet fought ſo obſtinately, that they would in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability have raviſhed the Victory from a leſs expert and valiant Chieftain than he. For he ranged his People in Battle with ſo much Judgment, and made them fight in ſuch admirable Order, that in ſpite of the moſt deſperate Efforts the Enemies could make to break his Squadrons, it was impoſſible for them to effect their Purpoſe. For that Great Man was obſerved with an indefatigable Care, to encourage his Captains and Seamen, and influence them to make his Fleet tack and wheel about with ſuch nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and well-timed Motions, that at the leaſt ſignal
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:29562:191"/> he was immediately obeyed, and thereby loſt no opportunity to charge the Enemies where there was any proſpect of advantage. But his Courage appeared in its Chiefeſt Luſtre when he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to break into the heart of the Enemies Fleet to relieve any of his Ships and Commanders that were diſtreſſed and ſurrounded by them; ſo that by his preſence and the good Order he gave e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where and in every thing, he from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning of the fight did all that could be done to trace out himſelf a way to Victory.</p>
            <p>Neither was the bravery of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> leſs Admirable than that of <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his undaunted boldneſs in breaking in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Enemies, and in expoſing himſelf ſo much to the moſt imminent dangers, that he was ſeveral times forced to change his Ship. At the ſight of his Flag the Enemies ſeldom failed ſoon to turn Tail and fly, looking upon him to be the ſcourge of their Arms. And becauſe his Flag had been put up in ſeveral other Ships he was forced to remove into during the fight, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> askt, whether there were five or ſix <hi>Tromp</hi>'s in the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet or no? For indeed, it may be ſaid, he was in a manner every where, never recoiling, but being often encloſed in the midſt of the Enemies Squadrons, enduring the greateſt fire of their Guns by the terrible and frequent broad ſides, they let flie at him. The reſt of the Officers of the Fleet, both General and Inferiour, ſtrove likewiſe with Emulation, which ſhould give the moſt ſignal marks of their Courage in that fierce Engagement. However the gaining of that Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle coſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> the Blood and Lives of a great many brave men who died there in the Bed of Honour, <hi>viz. Cornelius Evertſz,</hi> Vice Admiral <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hulſt,</hi> Rear Admiral <hi>Staghouwer,</hi> the Captains <hi>Otho Van Treſlong, Solomonſz, Janſz, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ttenhout, Wouter, Wyngaarden, Adam Hourtuin, Simon Bink,</hi> and about 800 Seamen or Soldiers. The Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:29562:191"/> of the wounded amounted to 11 or 1200, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom was Captain <hi>Vikrot</hi> who died a little while after at <hi>Hoorne.</hi> But the loſs of the <hi>English,</hi> was as we have ſaid, related to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably greater, there being reckoned to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 6000 men killed, amongſt whom were the Vice Admirals, <hi>Sir Wil. Barkley</hi> and Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Mings,</hi> and ſeveral Captains. And about 3000 <hi>English</hi> were made Priſoners, that were either ſaved out of the ſhips that were ſunk, or elſe found on board thoſe that were taken. Beſides which, the <hi>Holland</hi> Accounts rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon them to have loſt 23 men of War, whereof 17 were ſaid to be burnt, or ſunk, and the other 6, <hi>viz. the Swiftſure, the Loyal George, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venwolden,</hi> and <hi>the Couvertyne</hi> were carried into <hi>Goree,</hi> and <hi>the Eſſex</hi> and <hi>the Nagelboom</hi> into the <hi>Texel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt other remarkable paſſages in that fight, the undaunted Reſolution of Vice-Admiral <hi>Barkley</hi> was much admired, who having 40 men killed on board him, and being no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make reſiſtance, yet was ſo obſtinately bent to fight, that he would take no quarter, and would have killed with his own hand 3 or 4 of his Enemies that had boarded his Ship; but at laſt being ſhot into the throat with a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Bullet, he retired into the Captains Cabbin, where laying himſelf down at his length on a Table, he was found in that poſture dead by the Victors, all over beſmear'd with the blood flowing out of his wounds. Rear Admiral <hi>Sweers,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boarded Admiral <hi>Ayſchew</hi>'s Ship, this Latter delivered to him the Keys of his and yielded himſelf up to the diſcretion of the Victour. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> took out of his Ship, 500 men, and a little while after the flames get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Powder Room, it blew up about 11 a Clock at night. That Ship carried 92 Guns, of which thoſe of the loweſt Tire were of thirty ſix Pounds Bore, and there were 8 of 48. Her whole Compliment of Men was 620, and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:29562:192"/> ſhe was the ſame Ship that the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> embark'd in when he returned to be Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in his Throne, in 1660. Vice Admiral <hi>Mings</hi> having received a Musket ſhot in his throat ſtood about half an hour holding his Finger upon the wound, to keep it cloſed, and to ſtop the blood, but a ſecond Musket ſhot taking him in the neck he died, after having given moſt ſignal proofs of his Courage to the very laſt gaſp. Admiral <hi>Ayſchew</hi> was carried to the <hi>Chatellany</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> on the 16th. of <hi>June,</hi> from whence he was Conducted to the Audience of their High and Mightineſſes, and afterwards carried to <hi>Louveſtein,</hi> under a good Guard of Horſe, from whence he writ the following Letter to His <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>

That day many of our Ships were extremely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged, in the Number of which was that of the Duke of <hi>Albemarl.</hi> Some <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Aſhes, as well by our Fire-ſhips, as by their Powder taking Fire. The next day we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the fight with much Reſolution and Courage. But on the 3d. day I was encloſed by the Enemies together with ſome other Ships of my Squadron, and being vigorouſly attackt was forced to my great

                     </note> the honours due to the great men were not incompatible with the duties of War, and that Virtue and Valour ought to

Which induced us to give ſome ſingular marks of it in relation to the Body of S r <hi>Willaim Barkley</hi> Vice Admiral of the White Squadron in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Fleet. He gave ſuch great proofs of his bravery and undaunted Courage in the laſt fight, that we were willing to pay thoſe beſt duties to his Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious memory. For that effect we have Order'd his Body to be embalm'd, till ſuch time as his near Relations, and thoſe to whom his memory is dear can otherwiſe diſpoſe of it, as they shall think beſt.

But if on the contrary, your Majeſty shall chuſe rather to have him Inter'd in the place where he now is, you will be pleaſed to let us know your will, to which we shall always endeavour to conform our ſelves, as far as the preſent State of affairs will permit.

            <p>Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>John Evertſz,</hi> whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct had appear'd ſuſpicious, and whom the States, to appeaſe the incenſed People, had order'd to quit his Employment for a time, would needs ſollicite for a re-eſtabliſhment after the death of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and for that effect he writ to the States of <hi>Zealand,</hi> repreſenting to them, That he paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh'd he might be permitted to render his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to his Country as he had done before, in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Lieutenant-Admiral of that Province: That he ardently deſir'd to ſacrifice his Life for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Intereſt, in ſo preſſing an Occaſion as that as
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:29562:194"/> his Father, four of his Brothers, and one of his Sons had done before him with ſo much Glory, who all had the Happineſs to die in the Service of the State, with their Arms in their Hands, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ſignaliz'd themſelves in many Battels. The States of <hi>Zealand</hi> making Reflection upon his conſummate Experience in Sea-affairs, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage and good Conduct he had ſhewn in ſeveral Battels, and even in the very laſt Years Fight, according to the unanimous Teſtimony of all the Officers of the Fleet, granted his Demands, as being perſwaded, that at a time when they had loſt ſo many great Men, this Gentleman might do good Services to his Country by ſucceeding them. And accordingly having propos'd it in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the States-General, they conſented to it.</p>
            <p>The States Fleet being got ready to put to Sea again, and being 60 ſail ſtrong of Men of War or Frigats, unmoor'd on the 5th of <hi>July</hi> from <hi>Wielin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> under the Conduct of Admiral <hi>de Ruiter;</hi> and ſome regular Land-Troops, drawn out of the Garriſons, were privately march'd beforehand, to be embark'd on board ſome Tranſport-ſhips, which were deſign'd to make a Deſcent. And all the whole Fleet being thus advanced over againſt <hi>Schoonevelt,</hi> was reinforced with 5 Men of War and 7 Frigats, beſides another Reinforcement they receiv d ſome days after, by the arrival of Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> and ſome other general Officers, out of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> or the <hi>Texel.</hi> The great diligence and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that was uſed to get betimes to Sea, and to prevent the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> made them conceive great Hopes of Succeſs; for they promiſed themſelves to be able to ſurprize the Enemies, to enter into the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> or <hi>Harwich,</hi> to make ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable havock there, and deſtroy the Enemy's Fleet, or at leaſt to make ſome Deſcent. But they were mightily ſurpriz'd when they ſaw thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom they thought they had maul'd and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd beyond a recovery for that Year, appear of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:29562:195"/> a ſudden towards <hi>Diep Royal,</hi> with a Fleet of no leſs than 88 ſail of Men of War or Frigats, 13 Fireſhips, 20 Advice-Yatchts, beſides Tranſport-ſhips; ſo that the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, who had had Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the ſetting out of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, knew ſo well how to ſecure themſelves of all the Poſts where any Deſcent could be made, by placing there both Horſe and Foot, that they quite broke all the Deſigns of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who ſaw themſelves thereby diſabled to attempt any thing for want of good Sounders.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was divided into three Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, the firſt of which was under the immediate Conduct of Lieutenant-Admiral General <hi>de Ruiter;</hi> the ſecond under the Lieutenant-Admirals <hi>Evertſz,</hi> and <hi>Tierke Hiddes de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries;</hi> and the third was commanded by the Lieutenant-Admirals <hi>Tromp</hi> and <hi>Van Meppel;</hi> and in that order they kept the mouth of the <hi>Thames</hi> ſhut up till the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and then the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, being 90 ſail ſtrong, taking advantage of the Tide, came out of the River in ſight of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, which gave place to them, becauſe <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was afraid of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aground upon the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo had done all he could to make his Fleet ſheer off to a convenient diſtance from it, that he might give no Advantage to the Enemy ſo near their own Coaſts. And as it hapned, 'twas a great Happineſs for the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet they had done ſo; for the next day, the Wind riſing high, was follow'd with a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tempeſt of Thunder, Lightning, and a great Rain; but, which laſted not very long, the next day, <hi>viz.</hi> the 4th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the two hoſtile Fleets anchor'd pretty near one-another, and paſſed all the Night in preſence one of the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Navy commanded by General <hi>Monk</hi> was compoſed of 90 ſail of Men of War, and 20 Fireſhips, and was likewiſe divided into three Squadrons, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>White</hi> Squadron, commanded by Sir <hi>Thomas Allen;</hi> the <hi>Red</hi> one, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:29562:195"/> of General <hi>Monk;</hi> and the <hi>Blew</hi> one, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Sir <hi>Jeremy Smith.</hi> The fight begun about noon next day, and was ſo very diſaſtrous to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> that it render'd almoſt for ever ireconcilable the two greateſt Men for Sea-affairs that ever the Ocean bore, or that ever the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> had to command their Fleets; I mean, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and <hi>Tromp:</hi> Whether it were that that Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding proceeded from the Jealouſie <hi>Tromp</hi> had conceived, by reaſon of the <hi>States</hi> conferring upon <hi>de Ruiter</hi> the chief Command of the Fleet at his return from <hi>Guiney;</hi> or whether Providence, that preſided over all Events, had a mind to conceal from us the true Cauſe of it, we know not; but yet methinks 'tis more probable to believe, that Envy, which is always the Enemy of the Vertue and Merit of Great Men, was minded that way ſpightfully to make a mortal thruſt at the Reputation of <hi>Tromp;</hi> but that his Reputation was always ſo well and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſh'd in the World, that nothing will ever be able to ſhake it, nor make the leaſt impreſſion upon it. Let us ſay then rather, that in the heat of the Fight, and being tranſported by his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Eagerneſs and Intrepidity, he would needs give chaſe to the <hi>English</hi> Blew Squadron, and that was it that was all his Crime; for if <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and the Lieutenant-Admirals <hi>Evertſz</hi> and <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries</hi> had gained any advantage over the <hi>English,</hi> I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, they never would have complain'd that <hi>Tromp</hi> had deſerted them. In the mean while, by a ſad reverſe of Jadiſh and Unconſtant Fortune, the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who had gathered ſome Lawrels in the precedent Expedition, were forced in this laſt to yield to the <hi>English</hi> the ſo much conteſted Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Sea.</p>
            <p>The better to ſatisfie the World of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Circumſtances of that famous Fight, we ſhall inſert here the Letters written by the general Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Fleet, to the <hi>States,</hi> about it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Letter to the States about the Fight in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1666.</note>SInce my laſt, of the 4th of this Month, before Noon, the 2 Fleets engaged in Fight, about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Clock, the Wind at North, our Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, under the Conduct of Lieutenant-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Evertſz,</hi> begun the Attack, and engaged with the Enemies <hi>White</hi> Squadron: The main Battel, under my own Command, fought againſt the <hi>Red</hi> Squadron; but it was a great ſurprize to me, when I ſaw Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rear, inſtead of advancing with his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, to lag behind, which gave opportunity to the <hi>English</hi> to ſeparate us, and get between him and I. I am alſo obliged to tell you, That I did not perceive he was in any Action with them till towards Evening, when he fought a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while againſt ſome Ships of the <hi>Blew</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron. However it was, my Ship being attackt by the <hi>Soveraign</hi> General, on the one ſide, and by the <hi>Naſeby</hi> and ſeveral other Ships on the other, withſtood the greateſt ſhock of the Enemies, as likewiſe did my whole Squadron; but we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them ſo vigorouſly that after an obſtinate Fight of three hours, they were forced to quit us for ſome time. In that while General <hi>Monk</hi>'s Ship was ſo ſhatter'd, that he was forced to change his Ship, as we found by the removal of the Admiral's Flag; as was afterwards more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly reported to us. We therefore took our advantage of the Reſpite and Releaſe given us by the <hi>English,</hi> to repair our Loſſes and Damages; and having obſerved that our Vanguard went ſtill further and further from my Squadron, following the advantage of the Weathergage which they had gotten, I fired ſome Guns, to command them to veer back towards the Admirals Flag, but that was not able to ſtop them. The <hi>English</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral having remarkt that, came pouring with his Squadron upon me and ſome other Ships belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:29562:196"/> to my Flag, which engaged me in a cruel fight, which yet I maintain'd vigorouſly, in hopes that either <hi>Tromp</hi> or <hi>Meppel</hi> would come in to my aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from behind, or elſe Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>Evertſz,</hi> who had the Vanguard, from before; but I afterwards found that I had but vainly flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf with that Hopes, ſo that my Ship ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had all her Sails and Rigging ſhot down by the board, I ſaw my ſelf diſabled to govern her any longer: and being thus reduced into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition not to be able to make any more reſiſtance, by reaſon of the great number of killed and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I had on board me, I was conſtrained with ſmall ſail to follow the body of my Squadron, which began to fly. As for Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> who had the weathergage, it was eaſie for him to have veered back towards us, whereas it was impoſſible for us to move towards him; and I know not what obliged him not to do it. Seeing our ſelves thus deſerted, we thought there was no other Remedy left for our preſervation, but to tack away to the ſouthward, and to fight retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Beſides that, the Calm which began to come on would not ſuffer us quickly to get out of the Fight; and we being likewiſe glad to make but little ſail away, as thinking that by favour of the Night the ſaid Rear might joyn us, and that we might return all together to the Charge, and diſpute the Victory with the Enemy. But after all, when the Day was come, we perceived none come near us but the main Body of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, who began to play their Guns upon us in purſuing us: We anſwered them as well as we could, from behind; but the <hi>English</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached out a Fireſhip to come and burn me to Aſhes, I made my Barge advance, which was backt by ſome others, into which thoſe brave <hi>French</hi> Volunteer Lords, <hi>de Lorrain, de Lavoy,</hi> and <hi>de Coaſlin</hi> leapt with their Retinue, who went and forced the Fireſhip's Men to jump into the Sea,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:29562:197"/> and ſave themſelves by ſwimming, after they had ſet Fire to her, and ſo by that glorious Action pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Admiral Ship from Flames. In the mean while having diſcovered ſome of our Ships that were ſcattered from us in the Darkneſs of the Night, the <hi>English</hi> ſent a Detachment of ſome Ships from their Fleet to give them Chace; which as ſoon as I perceived I ſummoned all the Officers on Board the Admiral Ship, 20 of which were commanded by Order of Vice-Admiral <hi>Bankert,</hi> to oppoſe the Deſign of the Enemies. As ſoon as the Account of the Ammunition and Proviſion, which the ſaid Officers of the Fleet have need of, as alſo of the Loſſes and Damages they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, ſhall be drawn up, as they have repreſented it to me ſeveral times, I will take Care to ſend it to the Colleges of the Admiralties. I have alſo been informed in general, with much Regret, of the Death of ſome of our General Officers and Captains; namely, of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>John Evertſz,</hi> who having one of his Legs ſhot off, died a little after. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tierke Hiddes de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries,</hi> has likewiſe a Leg ſhot off, and is in Danger of Death; his Ship loſt us in the Night, and that of Vice-Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi> is ſunk: Vice-Admiral <hi>Koenders</hi> is likewiſe killed, as alſo the Captains <hi>Ruth Maximilian, Jeupian Poel,</hi> and <hi>Henry Vroom.</hi> Captain <hi>Hugh van Nieuhof</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt a Leg, and <hi>Cornelius Hogenhoek</hi> being wounded in the Belly are alſo in great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loſing their Lives. As for the Enemies Loſſes, I have yet no Knowledge of them, but by the Report of the aboveſaid Officers, 2 <hi>English</hi> Ships were ſunk, and 2 burnt. However, it is certain, and we were Eye-Witneſſes of it, that they were very roughly treated, and that moſt part of their Ships will be forced to retire ſoundly bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. I am peſwaded your High and Mightineſſes will be informed of it, even before you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this preſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The next morning, finding our ſelves neer the Galloper, we continued ſtill for ſome time to purſue the Enemies, but ſeeing 'twas to no purpoſe, and that nothing was able to make them ſtop, we reſolved to veer back towards Admiral <hi>de Ruiter.</hi> When the flying <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſaw that, they veered back towards us, and followed us with little Sail till the Dusk of Night. Then we diſcovered the main Body of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet to Leeward of us; who Luffed, to make up to joyn us; but we could hear nothing all the while neither of Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> nor of the other General Officers of our Fleet, till towards Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we diſcerned a Ship coming towards us, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to us to be that of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tierke Hiddes,</hi> but becauſe ſhe had neither Flag nor Top-maſt, we took that for an unlucky preſage. We are arrived this Day before <hi>Wielingen,</hi> with our Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron which is ſtill in a good Condition, and wants nothing but Ammunition. If we were ſo happy as to be informed where Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> is, we would uſe all diligence imaginable to go and joyn him. The Main Body of the Enemies Fleet luffs as much as

                  <p>SInce my laſt, written on the 5th of this Month, Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> has appeared in the Road with the Squadron under his command, and as far as I could obſerve as it was paſſing, it was very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing at all endamaged. He has reported to me, That on the 4th towards the Evening, he was in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Blue Squadron,</hi> which he put to the Rout, after he had burnt one of their Ships carrying <hi>64</hi> Guns, whereof <hi>53</hi> were of Braſs, and a Fireſhip which he alſo deſtroyed with the Flames. The Ship of the deceaſed Admiral <hi>Tierke Hiddes de Uries</hi> is alſo come, very much ſhattered, into the Road with the ſaid Squadron of <hi>Tromp,</hi> ſo that of all the States Fleet we have loſt only the Ship of Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Bankert,</hi> and that of <hi>Ruird Hille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandt.</hi> Yeſterday in the Evening we came to an anchor between <hi>Zouteland</hi> and <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> from whence we perceived the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet before our Coaſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of about <hi>80</hi> Sail great and ſmall. I hourly expect the Deputies of your High and Mightineſſes, to give Order about all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Tho' the Loſs of this Battle was very ſenſible to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> yet they pretended, the <hi>English</hi> had no reaſon to brag of having got any other Advantage over the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet than that of
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:29562:199"/> having divided their Squadrons; tho' 'tis true, they thought by that means the more eaſily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them one after another. Here follows an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the Letter ſent by Prince <hi>Robert</hi> and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monk,</hi> to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> after the Fight, by which it appears what their Deſign was. <hi>We flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered our ſelves very much, that</hi> de Ruiter <hi>would fall into our Hands; but it was calm Weather, and our ſmall Frigats were not ſuch nimble Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as theirs. They were before their own Coaſts, and we were afraid of running upon the Sand Banks. In the mean while as we were holding a Council of War, we heard ſome firing of Guns towards the North-weſt, which made us preſume that it was</hi> Tromp, <hi>with</hi> Smith, <hi>and therefore we reſolved to make up towards him before he approached any nearer Home. But</hi> Tromp <hi>retired ſafely, and we follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the</hi> Royal Charles, <hi>till we came within</hi> 6 <hi>Fathoms depth of Water,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Smith,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Blue Squadron,</hi> met with but a very ill Reception in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they were the firſt that begun to flie, and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the other 2 Squadrons made great Complaints againſt him.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Deputies of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralties and the Plenipotentiaries of the States with the Penſioner <hi>de Wit,</hi> came on board Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> as well to inform themſelves of the particulars of the fight, as to give orders for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Fleet to Sea again with all imaginable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. In that time the Differences between the two Admirals <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and <hi>Tromp</hi> begun to break out. For <hi>de Ruiter</hi> complained by word of mouth to the Deputies and Plenipotentiaries, as he had done before by Letter, to the States, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct obſerved by <hi>Tromp,</hi> and openly charged him with all the diſorder that had hapned in the Fleet, and with the ill ſucceſs of the Battle. <hi>Tromp</hi> having underſtood all the ſhrewd paſſes <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had made at his Reputation, thought
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:29562:199"/> of nothing more than of Vindicating himſelf from ſo great and bloody an outrage, by charging <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> in return, with all the blame he imputed to him: And for that effect, he writ the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letter to the States General, and to the States of <hi>Holland.</hi>

                  <p>I Find my ſelf indiſpenſably obliged to inform you of all the particulars of the laſt fight between your Fleet, and that of his <hi>British</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. On the 4th. of this Month, the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy came up right to us, the wind at North-weſt mixt with a Calm. Our Fleet was to Lee-ward, Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> having the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, advanced in good order by favour of the Wind. At that motion, the White Squadron, followed by the main body of the <hi>English</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fell upon him, whilſt <hi>de Ruiter</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the main body of our Fleet, ſtaid about two hours and an half below the Rear of which I had the Conduct, ſo that Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> was already ſo far advanced, that his Flag was hardly to be diſcerned, and the great diſtance there was between the Van and the Main Battle of our Fleet gave the <hi>English</hi> the greateſt advantage in the world to ſeparate one from the other. And Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> who remained immovable in his poſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan then only to advance to follow <hi>Evertſz</hi> when the Van-guards of the two Hoſtile Fleets begun to Cannonade one another. In the mean while my Squadron that ſhut up the Rear was forced to remain in its poſt till <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was advanced, and then being impatient to engage, we endeavour'd to gain the Weather-gage, to be able to get up to the <hi>English,</hi> whilſt a part of the ſhips of <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Squadron were ſtill mingled among ours. As our Squadron was thus advancing in good order, the Rear Admiral
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:29562:200"/> of the Blue Squadron, followed by a Fire-ſhip came and fell upon one of our foremoſt ſhips, which our Rear-Admiral <hi>Vander Zaan</hi> ſeeing, he ſet the Enemies Fire-ſhip on fire with ſhot from his great guns. The Admiral of the Blue Squadron followed likewiſe by a Fire-ſhip came up with me and attackt me, Who was backed by the Captains <hi>de Haan</hi> and <hi>Van Amſtel.</hi> We plaid our Guns at him and at the other <hi>English</hi> ſhips, whereof one being very much ſhattered, and I finding it was practicable to get the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of her, we boarded her, being backt with a Fire-ſhip, and after we had battered her a long time with continual Broad ſides, we faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Fire-ſhip upon her, to burn her to Aſhes. That ſhip was called the <hi>Reſolution,</hi> and carried 64 Braſs Guns, and 2 Iron ones, and having 140 men on board her, whereof 45, among whom were a Pilot and a Quarter Maſter, were ſaved by our men. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Meppel,</hi> and Vice-Admiral <hi>Swers</hi> withſtood at the ſame time a very furious Shock. This latter fought a long time againſt the Vice-Admiral of the <hi>Blue Squadron,</hi> who returned often to the Charge upon him with freſh Men; but he was ſo vigorouſly repulſed by the brave <hi>Van Meppel,</hi> that he was forced to quit him with Loſs; However <hi>Van Meppel</hi>'s Ship was ſo miſerably ſhattered, that ſhe had above 5 Foot Water in her Hold. Our Squadron therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus engaged in Fight, ſeparated the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rear-Guard from their Main Battle, ſo that we fought with it till about 5 a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. And my Ship had then fired away 10300<hi>l</hi> of Powder. The Vice-Admiral of the <hi>Blue</hi> which was behind, within Cannon-ſhot from us, did all he could to burn Captain <hi>de Haan,</hi> but the Fire-ſhip's Crew that were detached for that purpoſe, ſeeing our Boats ready to receive them, retired with haſte, after they had received ſome Cannon-ſhot. We uſed our utmoſt Endeavour by towing to get
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:29562:200"/> up to him, but to no purpoſe. However, ſoon after the Wind beginning to freſhen, and being turned to the <hi>South-weſt,</hi> we took the Advantage of it to return again to the Charge. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I gave the Signal for our whole Squadron to fall all together at the ſame time upon the Enemy; and at the ſame time our other Ships, the Wind being changed, were endeavouring what they could, to get the Weather-gage. By the Favour of that freſh Gale, we came up with the Admiral of the <hi>Blue,</hi> whom we treated ſo roughly with our Guns, that he was at laſt diſabled; and his Maſter's Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin being ſet on Fire, he fired ſome Guns to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe his Vice and Rear-Admirals to veer back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him to come to his Aſſiſtance; but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fearing the Danger, inſtead of veering back towards him, ſhamefully betook themſelves to Flight; And had it not been for the Calm which then came on, in all probability, not only that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, but the moſt part of the Ships of his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron would have fallen into our Hands. Having gotten then ſuch great Advantages over the moſt conſiderable of the Enemies Squadrons, we were, in the Judgment of all Men experienced in Marine Affairs, engaged to purſue the Victory, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing an irreparable Blunder, we could not let them retire without giving them Chace; for ſuppoſing we had let the Enemies go off, and turned back to go to the Aſſiſtance of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> beſides that the Calm would not have permitted us, we ſhould have been the Cauſe of the Routing of the Ships of <hi>de Ruiters,</hi> and <hi>Evertſz</hi>'s Squadrons, becauſe they would have preſumed we had given way, and had the Enemies at our Backs, ſo that by that means, we ſhould not only have diſcouraged our own Ships, but have raiſed the Courage of our Enemies, who would not have failed in that caſe to purſue us. I leave it therefore to your High and Mightineſſes, and to all brave Marine Officers that have long time fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:29562:201"/> the Sea, to judge, Whether if Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had timely cut off the Enemies Vanguard from their main Body, as we did their Rear, we ſhould not have gained a ſignal Victory? I add, That that might have been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with ſo much the more Eaſe, becauſe our Van-Guard was ſtrong enough ſucceſsfully to have fought that of the Enemies. I proteſt to your High and Mightineſſes, That Partiality has had no ſhare in what has been ſet forth, I being ready to maintain in the Face of the whole World, that 'tis all conformable to the Truth; and I declare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, That I have done nothing that betrays my Intentions, which were for the Good of the Publick, and the Glory of my Country.</p>
                  <p>And now, High and Mightineſſes, I cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer without Reparation, that without having any Regard to all the faithful Services I have done, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> out of a Principle of Hatred and Jealouſie, ſhould offer ſuch a bloody Outrage to my Honour and Reputation, as to make me paſs for a villainous and ill-intentioned Man, only becauſe God did me the Favour to make me triumph over the Enemies with a ſmall Force, when he with a Strength incomparably greater, met only with Shame and Diſadvantage on his ſide. So then, if I have in this occaſion, acted contrary to my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Duty, I ſee my ſelf uncapable for the future to render my Services to my Country. And beſides, 'tis not now a Time to ſuffer any cowardly or villainous Perſons in the great Employments at Sea, but it is rather neceſſary, to make Choice of Prudent and Valiant Captains that may be ready at all times to ſacrifice their Eſtates and Lives for the Good of the State, which Advantages I can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanity ſay, I have hitherto poſſeſſed in ſuch a manner, that I believe neither Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> nor any other Man living upon the Face of the Earth, is able to raviſh them from me. But I apprehend with a ſenſible Regret, that many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:29562:201"/> will happen in the Fleet; and that the Officers and Seamen, when they come on Shore, will proceed to pernicious Extremities, which I pray God of his Clemency to avert, putting my g eateſt Hopes in him, and in the wiſe Conduct of your High and Mightineſſes, whom I recommend to his Holy Protection, and remain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But becauſe it was feared ſome Mutiny might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the Fleet by reaſon of the great Affection the Seamen bore to <hi>Tromp,</hi> the States forbad him to ſtir out of the <hi>Hague</hi> till further Order, and to go or write to the Fleet, upon pain of being accounted the Author of all the Miſchiefs that might enſue. And in Truth there was ſome Danger of it, but the good Order that was given and the Prudence that was uſed in ſo Nice a Buſineſs as that, reſtrained the Malecontents within the Bounds of Obedience. The ſame Day the States of <hi>Holland</hi> advanced to the Office of Lieutenant Admiral, vacant by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Tromp,</hi> Mr. <hi>de Gent,</hi> Colonel of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Regiment; <hi>Sweers</hi> likewiſe, who was Rear-Admiral before, was made Vice-Admiral of the ſame College in the Place of <hi>Vander Hulſt, Verburg</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Sweers</hi> in the Place of Rear-Admiral, and Captain <hi>David <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lug</hi> was made Rear-Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of the North, in the room of <hi>de Horn,</hi> who was killed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>De Gent</hi> being informed of the Honours the States were doing him, would fain have excuſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting them, and among other Reaſons he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, That having frequented the Sea but a little
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:29562:203"/> while he thought himſelf not capable to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Squadron; but the States preſſing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to accept the place that was preſented him, and <hi>Tromp</hi> with whom we had contracted an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friendſhip, joyning his perſwaſions with the inſtances of the States, he was at laſt prevailed with to conſent to it, and accordingly took the Oath in Quality of Lieutenant Admiral of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> about the end of the month. Thus <hi>Tromp</hi> after he had given ſo many ſignal proofs of his Courage, was at length conſtrained to quit the Sea ſervice.</p>

The <hi>English</hi> therefore together with <hi>Heemſkerk,</hi> held a Council, and after they had projected their enterprize, reſolved to put it in execution the next day at 8 in the morning.

And accordingly Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> having faſtned upon the ſhip of Captain <hi>Adelaar,</hi> one of the chief of the Convoys, reduced her to aſhes. The Captain after he had made all the reſiſtance poſſible, leaping at laſt into a Boat with ſixteen 16 of his men, to ſave himſelf, both he and they were unhappily ſwallowed up by the Waves. The ſecond Convoy ſhip was likewiſe burnt, but <hi>Tol,</hi> the Captain of her was more lucky than his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, for he eſcaped in his Boat. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſhips cut their Anchor Cables at ſo horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a ſpectacle to flie as well as they could from the fury of the flames. In the mean while the men in the three <hi>English</hi> Fire-ſhips that ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained advanc'd? Crying out! <hi>I am Heemſkerk the Author of the enterprize;</hi> and ſet fire to ſome Merchant ſhips richly laden, and bound for <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> which after their men had ſignaliz'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the utmoſt in their defence, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe burnt to aſhes. After that, the <hi>English</hi> with 22 Boats went out of the <hi>Brandaris,</hi> and by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their Oars and the Tide together gave chace to the Merchant ſhips, that were flying, and all of them they could reach, they ſet on fire with flaming truſſes of ſtraw which they threw into them. However, becauſe the <hi>English</hi> Seamen were
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:29562:204"/> Commanded under pain of death not to pillage, the Pilots and Maſters of the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhips found opportunity by that means to ſave their men and their Money in their Boats. Some of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy wretches that dwelt in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lie,</hi> fearing the <hi>English</hi> would come and plunder the Iſle, had with-drawn their beſt effects from thence, and tranſported them on board the Merchant-ſhips, ſo that they had the cruel diſpleaſure to ſee them deſtroyed by the flames. Three Privateers and one Merchant ſhip bound for <hi>Guiney</hi> well Arm'd and Provided with able Seamen made a very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous reſiſtance; for they repulſed the <hi>English,</hi> and ſunk ſome of their Boats, ſo that under their ſhelter, ſeveral rich Merchants deſigned for <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> were preſerved from the Enemies fire, who durſt follow them no further for fear of running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground.</p>

But their attempts had more ſucceſs in the Iſle of <hi>Schelling,</hi> for having landed 11 Companies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

In fine the <hi>English</hi> pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged what the fire had ſpared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holms</hi> would have carried on thoſe ſtrange ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes further into the Country, and two other Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the ſame Iſle were juſt ready to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the ſame rate; but that being obliged to ſtay till 24 hours were paſt, before he could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing more, and to wait for a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wind to execute his enterprize, and beſides, finding that the inhabitants having begun to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench themſelves at the Eaſt-ward of the Village, had raiſed two Batteries, and expected every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſome Cannon from <hi>Enkuiſen,</hi> he thought it would be two hazardous to puſh his deſign any further, and that it would be much better to think of retreating, and ſo ordered all his men to return immediately on board, and on the 20th. of Auguſt he rejoined the <hi>English</hi> Grand Fleet, by order of Prince <hi>Robert</hi> and General <hi>Monk,</hi> who ſeeing that ſickneſs begun to reign amongſt their Men, made ſail back towards the Coaſts of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>The States being ſenſibly concerned at the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief done by the <hi>English</hi> Incendiaries to thoſe poor Iſlanders, watcht all opportunities to Return them a Rowland for their Oliver, and in little time after, met with a very favourable one to wreck part of their Revenge. For two <hi>Dutch</hi>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:29562:205"/> men of War that were convoys, ſeconded by two others that had rid a good while at Anchor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Gluckſtadt,</hi> fell on the 27th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> with a fair Wind, upon a Merchant Fleet of 17 <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> ſhips that were at an Anchor near the <hi>New-Mill,</hi> and fired ſo terribly at them with their Guns, that not knowing where to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they cut their Anchor Cables, and fled to ſave themſelves. But when they of <hi>Hamborough</hi> ſaw them approach towards their Town, they ſounded an alarm; all the ſtreets were in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment filled with people, and it being juſt at the beginning of night, all the Town was on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den enlightned with a Million of Candles and Torches, and the Burghers were all in Arms. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 9 of the Clock, 4 Merchant ſhips, <hi>viz.</hi> 3 <hi>English,</hi> and one <hi>Hamburgher</hi> were on fire, this laſt hapning unluckily to ride too near the others, and if the wind had not chopt about to the North, it is certain, that all the reſt that eſcaped, would have likewiſe been reduced to Aſhes. Two days after that expedition, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was ſent for to come aſhore, to ſpeak with the Count <hi>d' Eſtrades</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, the Marqueſs of <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonds,</hi> and the Deputies of their High and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſes, which were met there, to treat about the place where the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was to join that of <hi>Holland.</hi> For the Duke of <hi>Beauford,</hi> Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> had been a long time expected home, and they had received advice, that he was ready to quit the Coaſts of <hi>Portugal</hi> whither he was gone ſome months before, in order to return to <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.</hi> In the mean while, the moſt Chriſtian King had Commanded the Count <hi>d' Eſtrades,</hi> to preſent the Order of <hi>St. Michael</hi> to <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the undaunted Courage and Singular Conduct he had ſhewn in the laſt Battle. But to return to what concerns the pretended Junction of the two Fleets, the Court of <hi>France</hi> after their uſual manner, contented themſelves with bubling
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:29562:206"/> off the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with fair promiſes and ſpecious hopes that vaniſht all but into ſmoak; for the Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as it was never intended, ſo it was never made.</p>
            <p>The States Fleet being got ready, unmoor'd on the 5th. of <hi>September,</hi> conſiſting of 71 men of War or Frigats, and 27 fire-ſhips. Beſides the New Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers abovementioned, Vice Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded as Lieutenant Admiral in the room of <hi>John Evertſz;</hi> and Captain <hi>Matthyſz</hi> was made Rear-Admiral of <hi>Zealand.</hi> The fleet was divided into 3 Squadrons; the firſt was Commanded by <hi>de Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himſelf; the ſecond by Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de Gent;</hi> and the third by Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Bankert.</hi> On the 8th of <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> fleet came to an Anchor between <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> and upon ſome advice receiv'd from <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Beauford,</hi> Admiral of <hi>France</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor'd from <hi>Rochelle:</hi> Nay, and that he was come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready as far as the mouth of the Channel, in order to join <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> the States fleet weighed Anchor on the 11th. in the morning, and made ſail towards <hi>Callis</hi> and <hi>Bullen:</hi> Where the Vice Admirals <hi>Sweers,</hi> and <hi>Evertſz,</hi> meeting with a great <hi>English</hi> ſhip, called the <hi>Loyal Charles,</hi> carrying 56 Guns, and 200 men, they took her. She had underwent a moſt terrible Tempeſt, in which ſhe had loſt her Fore-maſt and Bolt-ſprit, ſo that <hi>de Ruiter</hi> order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to be burnt. About noon, he heard, that the <hi>English</hi> fleet conſiſting of above 100 ſail was following after that of <hi>Holland,</hi> whereupon <hi>de Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> preſently put up a Red Flag as a ſignal to his fleet to fall all together at the ſame time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enemies. But the <hi>English</hi> Admiral tacking about to the North ward, ſheered away with all his Navy from the <hi>Dutch</hi> fleet, which chaſed them, and fired at their Rear, in the view of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of People that were got together on the Coaſts of <hi>France,</hi> and were ſpectators of the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Courage of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:29562:206"/> of the <hi>English,</hi> who, as was ſuppoſed, for want of Men, who in great Numbers had been ſwept away by Sickneſs, contented themſelves only with making a Shew at Sea, but did not think fit to hazard an Engagement, and ſo made towards <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> And as for the Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not, and ſo <hi>de Ruiter</hi> being weary of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long for him in vain, had Orders from the States, to conduct the Fleet back again into their reſpective Ports, and only to detach a Squadron out of them of 25 Men of War, to cruiſe to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to look for the Ships that were expected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Four Days after, the States had News of the Burning of <hi>London</hi> by the moſt terrible Fire that ever was yet ſeen.<note place="margin">Dreadful Fire of <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> For beginning on the 12/2 of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> it made ſuch an Advance by favour of the Wind, that it was not extinguiſhed till the 16/6th, that is to ſay, 5 Days after, when at laſt they were fain to ſmother it by blowing up ſome Houſes, as the laſt Remedy that could be thought of. It ſeemed as if Fire had been fallen from Heaven to puniſh that proud City, and that God, the juſt Revenger of Crimes had determined to reduce it into Aſhes, or at leaſt to chaſtiſe it in ſuch a manner, that it ſhould for ever wear laſting Marks of his Puniſhment. For that dreadful Conflagration extended from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Temple-bar,</hi> and in all that ſpace, there remained not a Houſe ſtanding all-a-long by the <hi>Thames,</hi> ſo that it may well be ſaid, That by that Judgment the Inhabitants of that great City, and even of all <hi>England</hi> ſuffered Loſſes incomparably greater and more ſenſible than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had lately cauſed to the Inhabitants of the Iſles of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lie</hi> and <hi>Schelling,</hi> which were eſteemed at Twelve Millions of <hi>Livers,</hi> whereas thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> amounted to One hundred Millions. And the Deſolation was ſo great that Multitudes of People were ſeen to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about almoſt in deep Deſpair without any Home or other Place of Shelter to go to, and were reduced
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:29562:207"/> to the greateſt Depth of Miſery, and would have periſhed by Hunger, if the King had not ordered ſome Proviſion to be made for their Subſiſtance, other particulars as well known, and amply recited in other Writings obvious every where, we ſhall omit to inſert here.</p>
            <p>The Penſioner <hi>de Wit</hi> upon that Advice, as he was an implacable Enemy to the King of <hi>England,</hi> as well as to the Houſe of <hi>Orange</hi> ſo nearly allied to that Royal Family, and had ſecretly blown up the Fire of that War, reſolved to make his beſt Advantage of it, and preſently writ to Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> to let him know, That ſo fatal and unforeſeen an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as that, might poſſibly induce the States to change the Reſolution they had before taken, to lay up their Fleet in their Ports, becauſe it had been certified from good Hands, That <hi>Monk</hi> was returned to <hi>London,</hi> and therefore it was eaſie to preſume, the <hi>English</hi> Fleet would not be ſo ſoon ready to unmoor. And the States accordingly by his Inſtigation writ to <hi>de Ruiter</hi> on the 26th of the ſame Month, that upon a piece of News of ſo great importance, they had reſolved to keep their Fleet out ſtill at Sea, till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Order. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> obeyed their Order, but without any Succeſs at that Time: For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſailing out again on the 5th of <hi>October,</hi> made a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as if they would advance to attack <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> but as ſoon as they ſaw him move towards them to engage them, they ſheered away again to avoid him. At that time the Duke of <hi>Beauford,</hi> Admiral of <hi>France</hi> ſent <hi>de Ruiter</hi> Word, that it was impoſſible for him to come and joyn him, and therefore deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to excuſe him for having put in with the <hi>French</hi> Fleet into <hi>Breſt.</hi> So <hi>de Ruiter</hi> ſeeing there was no appearance of attempting any thing to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, retired again about the middle of <hi>October</hi> with his Fleet, whereof a part put into <hi>Zealand,</hi> another into the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and the reſt into the <hi>Texel.</hi>

            <p>A little time after, there were ſome happy ſteps made towards a Peace for the States, as we have already ſaid, having written to the King of <hi>England</hi> about the Funeral of Sir <hi>William Barcley,</hi> that Prince was ſo ſenſibly touched with the oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deportment of the States in that matter, and with the Honours they had rendred to the Memory of a Perſon that was ſo dear to him, that he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them Thanks for it by the following Letter, dated the 11th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

And becauſe the near Relations of the Deceaſed deſire, his Body may be interred in the Tomb of his Anceſtors, upon the Offer you have made us, to grant them that Favour, we have conſented to it; and that the Veſſel deſigned for his Tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may not be attacked in its Paſſage by our Subjects, we have added to this incloſed, the neceſſary Paſſport.

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:29562:208"/> to ſtay in the Court of <hi>England</hi> expreſly upon that account, tho' your Majeſty had already recalled yours. Mr. <hi>Van Beuningen,</hi> our Miniſter extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary at the <hi>French</hi> Court, renewed them in the laſt Place in preſence of the Queen your Majeſty's Mother, to Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> your Embaſſador, without receiving any poſitive Anſwer thereto from your Majeſty. We could not with Juſtice, according to what is practiſed in ſuch Negotiations, have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered our Miniſter in the Conference held at <hi>Paris</hi> with the ſaid <hi>Hollis,</hi> to ſollicit him to make the Overture of the Conditions upon which your Majeſty pretended to make Peace, as we had done, or at leaſt to have agreed beforehand, that your Majeſty ſhould give a final Anſwer, ſincere, and without Reſerve to the Advances we had made, and that in a prefixed Time: But however to give Proofs at the very firſt of the ardent Paſſion that induces us to labour to bring about ſo Chriſtian a Work, we have paſſed over all thoſe Formalities, making it our Glory to make the firſt Advances, and to go as far with them on our ſide as is poſſible, hoping that your Majeſty acting in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the ſo much deſired Peace might be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without delay, and that by that means the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo much Chriſtian Blood as was ſhed in the enſuing Battles might have been prevented. And ſince by the Letter of the 11th of <hi>December</hi> laſt Year, and afterwards in the Conference held at <hi>Paris,</hi> it was propoſed to your Majeſty's Choice to treat of Peace, either under condition, That both Parties ſhould mutually reſtore all that each of them had taken from the other before or after the War, and thence to paſs to the Examination of the Pretenſions that were in queſtion before the War; or that each Party ſhould keep the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts they had made before or after the Rupture, with reſpect to the Time when the ſaid Offer was ſignified to the Parties; and that in conſequence of that, all the Pretenſions concerning any Loſſes
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:29562:209"/> or Damages ſuffered, ſhould be forgotten, and held for Null on both ſides. It ſeems to us, That the Clauſe ſpecified in the aboveſaid Letter of your Majeſty is already fully executed, and that thereby your Majeſty has been ſeveral times invited to the Concluſion of ſo pious a Work. For we cannot perſuade our ſelves, that as to what concerns the Offer of the aboveſaid Conditions, there can be any propoſed more advantageous, if Regard be had to Reaſon and to the Juſtice of the Cauſe, conſidering that all we poſſeſs, or that we have taken from your Majeſty or your Subjects, is adjudged to be good Prize, and ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved according to the Laws of a juſt War, ſince we took up Arms only for our own Defence; whereas, on the contrary, all that has been taken from the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> or their Subjects, which amounts to above 100 Ships, with their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes and Effects, as likewiſe the Fort of <hi>S. Andrew,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Boaviſta, New Holland,</hi> and <hi>Cabo Corſo,</hi> all that was taken by Surprize un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, and without any Declaration of War. And yet your Majeſty ſlighting ſo advantageous a Propoſition, never conſidered to explain your ſelf openly, nor to determine upon the Choice either the one or the other of the propoſed Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or ſo much as to relate the Reaſons you had to reject them, or at leaſt to make us a clear and ſincere Overture of what other Conditions might have induced you to a Peace, to which we have often ſolicited you. On the contrary, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty broke off the foreſaid Conference, which was the greateſt Hopes of thoſe that ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Peace, and which was happily begun in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Queen your Majeſty's Mother; you broke it off, we ſay, by the ſudden recalling of your Ambaſſador, without ſhewing any manner of way your Approbation of it. Things being thus, we leave your Majeſty to judge, what all thoſe general Proteſtations of Affection and Paſſion of
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:29562:209"/> Peace can tend to ſo long as they ſhall not be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by particular Conditions which are to be the Foundation of it. And becauſe Experience teaches us, That the Mediation of Foreign Power is not unprofitable but may contribute much to the Concluſion of ſo holy a Work, that Conſideration induced us to determine to accept of the Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the King of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> in the Confidence we have, that that Prince being equitable, will have regard to the juſt and Advantageous Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we make, tho' that Prince having been put by your Majeſty into the Number of your Allies, it ſeems obvious, that we might look upon him as ſuſpicious, and a Party adverſe to us, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as one intereſted in the Treaty. Beſides that, your Majeſty has declared, You could not enter into Negotiation without his Conſent. The Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> who are in War as well as we, againſt your Majeſty, have in like manner accepted the ſaid Mediation of <hi>Swedeland.</hi> We made no Difficulty at the very firſt Offer made to us of it, to give our Conſent to it in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it might be preſented to your Majeſty; but yet hitherto, whatever Inſtances have been made, it has been impoſſible for us to induce the Miniſter of the Crown of <hi>Swedeland</hi> reſiding here, to make us the ſame Declaration from your Majeſty; namely, Whether you would pleaſe to accept of the ſaid Mediation of <hi>Swedeland</hi> or no? as well in regard of our ſelves, as of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> our Allies, which being once granted, we proteſt again once more, not only in general Terms, that we continue ſtill in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſion that incites us to the Concluſion of a ſolid Peace, but we make all the particular Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beſides that Right and Juſtice can exact of us. And becauſe a general Declaration that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends no real expreſs and reaſonable Condition, either on the one ſide or the other is more capable to produce new Umbrages, and leave the Mind in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:29562:210"/> ſuſpenſe, than to promote a Treaty of Peace, we declare conſequently, That we ſtand to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that were made on our part in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence held at the Court of <hi>France</hi> in the preſence of the Queen, your Majeſty's Mother, as has been already related.</p>
                  <p>In fine, we pray your Majeſty to confirm the general Profeſſion and Proteſtation you have made, That you deſire nothing more than Peace, and to be pleaſed to joyn to it a particular Declaration, that may ſhew that you determine upon the Choice of one of the Conditions, which you may think convenient for that purpoſe; and in conſequence of it, your Majeſty is alſo prayed to be pleaſed to let the ſaid Conference already begun to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, as well in reſpect of the Place, as to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But if your Majeſty ſhould make any Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to do it, and ſhould have any Reaſons not to conſent to it, that then your Majeſty would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that the Mediating Miniſters of the Crown of <hi>Swedeland</hi> may make Choice of another Place, where not only our Plenipotentiaries, but likewiſe thoſe of our Allies as well as thoſe of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty may be obliged to meet with all Diligence. And we ſhall take it for one of the greateſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the ſincerity of the Proteſtation your Majeſty has ſo often repeated concerning Peace, if it ſtir up no Jealouſie nor Diſunion between us and our Allies, to obſtruct it.</p>
                  <p>In fine, we will wait your Majeſty's Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Writing, which being ſignified to us by the Miniſter of <hi>Sweden,</hi> by which the Mediation of that Prince, preſented to all the Members of the League, as well to the aforeſaid Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> as to us, ſhall be authorized. And we pray God to inſpire your Majeſty with ſuch Sentiments for Peace as we have our ſelves, and ſuch as may conſequently move you to reſolve to make Choice of the neceſſary means whereby to promote ſo great a Work; that ſo we may in a
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:29562:210"/> ſhort time enjoy the Effects of a firm, ſolid, and inviolable Peace, to be concluded between your Majeſty, and the Powers at preſent in War againſt <hi>England:</hi> And for our particular, we ſhall make moſt ardent Prayers to God for the Proſperity of your ſacred Perſon, and for the Subjects of the two States.</p>

We conſider that Mark of your Civility with all poſſible Reſentment, and we pray you to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that we will do the ſame by you, as often as occaſion ſhall ſerve.</p>
                  <p>As to the other Part of your Letter, concerning Peace, and the frank and free Anſwer we made you on the 14th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> by inviting you to ſeek it, we cannot enough complain, That all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances we have made for that purpoſe, ſhould end in no other effect, but to make us be charged with ill-grounded Reproaches that openly condemn the manner of Acting we have obſerved, tho all the World be informed to the contrary. Thoſe are without doubt ſuch Preliminaries, as are not very capable to facilitate it, and tis a thing altogether ſurprizing, that you ſhould endeavour to perſuade your own People, and all <hi>Europe</hi> at the ſame time, That we are the Aggreſſors and Authors of the fatal Conſequences which have been enkindled between us: You unjuſtly accuſe us of ſhutting our Ears to all the Propoſals you make for an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by refuſing to inform you of our lawful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions: In fine, you pretend that we alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:29562:211"/> it, whilſt you and your Allies deſire it, and paſſionately ſeek for it, whereas the Truth is, you your ſelves have to this very preſent Day refuſed to make the leaſt ſtep that was capable to advance it, and to extinguiſh the fatal Torch of War. This conduct ſo contrary to your pretended Intentions, obliges us for the Defending of our Honour, and the Juſtice of our Cauſe from ſuch ſenſible Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, to declare before the Face of the whole World, how ill-grounded your Reproaches are: It forces us, I ſay, to renew once more the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we have made for the Re-eſtabliſhment of Peace, ever ſince the very beginning of the War, and which yet you have always rejected. We proteſt to you then, that, if you think fit, for the Time to come, to charge your ſelves with all the Blame, which engages our Honour to provide for its Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then we may by the Aſſiſtance of Heaven, deliberate with Succeſs about the means that ſhall be judged proper to pacifie our Troubles, and put a ſtop to the cruel Effuſion of ſo much Proteſtant Blood. In the mean while we cannot forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the following Particulars, to undeceive the Publick.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we have made ſeveral preſſing Inſtances, but all to no purpoſe, to move you to make Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the Damages ſuffered by us and our Subjects, which you were engaged to do by the laſt Treaty, which was not violated on our part.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Commanders of your Fleet in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> prohibited our Ships under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Earl of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> the Entrance, of a Harbour, where there had been a long Time an <hi>English</hi> Manufactory ſettled, provided with a great Quantity of Merchandiſes deſigned for the lading back of the ſaid Ships at their Return; all which Merchandiſes were ſoon after ſtopt by your Officers, under pretence, That you having declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed War againſt the Princes with whom we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:29562:211"/> to trade, it was no longer lawful for us to have any more Commerce with them. And about the ſame Time, that Imperious and Extravagant Declaration was publiſhed likewiſe in your Name, in <hi>Africa,</hi> by the Officer that commands there for you, with a Prohibition to all our Subjects to traffick with the Inhabitants of that Country; ſo that when we demanded Reparation for the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages ſuffered, ſhewing you an Authentick Copy of the Declaration lately publiſhed there in your Name, againſt the Glory and Intereſt of the Kings and Princes that have Commerce there, and that are not able without Reſentment to endure ſo cruel an Outrage, you were pleaſed to diſown that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and abſolutely refuſed to give us any Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſay, That as ſoon as ever your Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour complained of the Hoſtility lately committed by Captain <hi>Holms</hi> in taking of your Fort near <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> we aſſured him upon our Royal Word, That that Attempt was committed without our Knowledg and Participation; ſo that after having diſavowed it, we ſummoned him up to appear here, and after having ſeriouſly examined the Affair, we declared, that the ſaid <hi>Holms</hi> ſhould be puniſhed according to the Rigor of the Laws, if he were found guilty, with Intention to make Reparation for the Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges you had ſuffered. But that Proteſtation, how ſincere ſoever it were, was not capable to ſatisfie you, tho' it ought to have done ſo however, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tenour of the Treaty: On the contrary, you perſiſted to reproach us with having authorized the Inſult made by the ſaid Captain; who being at length come back into <hi>England,</hi> we forbad him to preſent himſelf at Court, and what is more, we committed him preſently to the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> where he continued Priſoner till after the Rupture. And yet your Ambaſſadour never in all that Time advanced any thing againſt him, that was a ſufficient Ground to bring him to
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:29562:212"/> his Trial; And what is more, <hi>Holms</hi> alledged, That before he attacked your Fort, he intercepted in his Way to <hi>Guiney,</hi> Orders by which your Officers were enjoyned to ſeize upon the Caſtle of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine,</hi> which they afterwards actually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Iſle of <hi>Poleroon</hi> was not delivered into our Hands, according to the Conditions of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tho' we were engaged to great Expences, in Arming out two Fleets at two different Times, which we ſent thither to go and take Poſſeſſion of it; the Governours excuſing themſelves, by the Orders that had been ſignified to them, alledging they were not ſufficient for their diſcharge.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſay, That <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had order to attack our Subjects, at the ſame Time when you cauſed Inſtances to be made to us, to ſtop the Departure of our Fleet deſigned for <hi>Guiney,</hi> under fair Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, That your Fleet ſhould ſtay in their Ports in Expectation of coming to an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; at a Time, I ſay, when you were ſolliciting us to joyn our two Fleets together, to go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Corſairs</hi> of <hi>Algiers</hi> to their Duty, which we conſented to with Pleaſure. And yet <hi>de Ruiter</hi> ſeparating himſelf from our Forces in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi> without giving the leaſt Notice of his Deſign, went to the Coaſts of <hi>Guiney</hi> to commit all ſorts of Hoſtility againſt our Subjects, and to ſeize upon the Country under our Obedience. All that paſſed before we had cauſed any of your Ships that were ſtoped, to be ſold, or that we had attempted the leaſt thing againſt your Subjects. Theſe Five Points being proved, and being entirely conformable to the Truth, as we have ſhewn, and all theſe things having paſt before we thought of providing for our Security, by uſing the means an Offenſive War engaged us to, we doubt not but you will paſs in the World for the Aggreſſors, and that our Honour will for the future be ſafe from being aſperſed with the Blame which ought wholly
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:29562:212"/> to be charged upon you. A War being thus kindled then, and God having bleſt our Arms with happy ſucceſs, we find our ſelves ſo much the more inclined to Peace, and evidently to ſet forth the ſenſible outrages that are done us, by repreſenting as if we were obſtinately bent to continue the War by refuſing to propoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to procure a Peace.</p>
                  <p>As for the overture made to us by your Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador during the time he remained in this Court, we refer our ſelves to the anſwers we made to all the memorials he preſented us, which give ſufficient Teſtimony of the inclinations we have for Peace.</p>
                  <p>As to what paſſed in the particular Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we had together, it is eaſy for you to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy your ſelves about it by the faithful Report of a man of Honour in whom we have had an extream confidence, and we wiſh he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf, whether we have not always Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified a great Averſion to War, and as much inclination for Peace as a Chriſtian is obliged to have, not thinking it fit to commit particulars to writing, that we might not expoſe our ſelves to thoſe Inconveniences which your manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding would have excited at that time.</p>
                  <p>As for what concerns the recalling of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy from the <hi>Hague,</hi> before your Ambaſſador was called from <hi>London,</hi> it is notorious, he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thence by the cruel Treatments uſed to him, for being diſpoiled of all the privileges annext to his Character, his Domeſticks being impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and notwithſtanding all the Complaints made of it from us, and the promiſes made us, that the like ſhould not happen any more, his ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary being put alſo under an arreſt, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſonable pretence, and guards being placed before his houſe, and nothing having been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that was capable of ſtirring up the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to riſe upon him, all thoſe violences, I ſay,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:29562:213"/> obliged him to provide for the ſecurity of his perſon by a handſom retreat.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the moſt Chriſtian Kings Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, after a ſtay of ſome months, and after we had accepted their Mediation, made us ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular propoſitions, but it is true likewiſe, that they afterwards diſavow'd them, as they were ordered by you to do, and gave us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that you had abſolutely diſapproved them, in confidence that the ſickneſs that reigned then in our Kingdom had ſo much weakned it, and reduced our people into ſo pitious a Condition, that it would be impoſſible for us to put out our Fleet to Sea again. The Ambaſſadors of the Court of <hi>France</hi> preſented afterwards ſome other Memorials, aſſuring us from the King their Maſter, that he would engage to make you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the project that had been propoſed; and that as to what concerned the exorbitant and unreaſonable demand we had made, it ſeemed improper to ſerve for the ground of a Treaty; adding, that your Ambaſſador might receive full power to treat of thoſe propoſitions, or elſe of ſome others equally profitable to both Parties. And there their Mediation ended, ſo that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, after having declared, that upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of the aboveſaid propoſitions, their Maſter would be obliged to aſſiſt you during the reſt of the War. Things then having paſt in that manner, 'tis eaſy to Judge whether we are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in a State to make you any other propoſals on our part.</p>
                  <p>As to what paſſed at <hi>Paris</hi> between our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador Extraordinary, and Mr. <hi>Van Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningen,</hi> we think our ſelves obliged to relate it a little at length, to undeceive the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by informing them what pains was taken, to perſwade them, that we were formally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a Negotiation, that reaſonable and advantageous propoſals had been therein made us,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:29562:213"/> but that we had rejected them, and that in fine by a Criminal obſtinacy we had broken off the Negotiation. A ſound Judgment may be made how things paſſed by what we are going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, that you may be diſabuſed of the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Account that has been given of them, and of the falſe prejudices pretended to be drawn from thence.</p>
                  <p>We could do no leſs than to recall our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador Extraordinary from the Court of <hi>France</hi> after the recalling of the Ambaſſadors of the moſt Chriſtian King, and the Declaration of War that follow'd cloſe after it. Our Ambaſſadour then having ſignified his Letters of Revocation, being very much indiſpoſed, a great Lord of the Court that was much conſidered, came to viſit him, and told him as a ſecret he intruſted to him, that the King his Maſter took all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable pains to induce you to a Peace, that Mr. <hi>Van Beuningen</hi> your Envoy would be ready to make an overture of ſome propoſitions, that might be made for a ground for it. And therefore for that effect he prayed him to defer his Voyage, and to order it ſo as to meet the ſaid Envoy at the Queen our Mothers Palace to treat there in her preſence about the means of attaining to a Peace. Our Ambaſſador anſwered him? that having received his Audience of leave, he was deveſted of his Character, that he had no power to enter into a Negotiation, and that according to his orders he was obliged to depart as ſoon as ever his health would permit him. A few days after, the ſame Lord made him a ſecond viſit, in which he renewed his inſtances, and declared to him in his Maſters Name, that if he perſiſted in his Reſolution to depart, without hearing what they had to propoſe to him for promoting of a Peace, he would undoubtedly be charged with all the blood that was going to be ſpilt, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving refuſed to lend an Ear to thoſe expedients
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:29562:214"/> that might be capable to prevent ſo great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. Upon ſuch preſſing Sollicitations, our Ambaſſador promiſed to meet them at the Queen our Mothers Palace, declaring however, that he had no power, but that if he did it, it would be out of Complaiſance and Curioſity to hear what propoſals they had to make. And accordingly he went thither at the appointed hour, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did one of the Miniſters of the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King. Their Converſation having been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome time in diſcourſing about the War, and your Envoy obſtinately maintaining that we were the Aggreſſors, he propoſed again the ſame Alternative that you now have newly propoſed to us, to which he demanded a poſitive anſwer, namely, <hi>That reparation ſhould be made on both ſides for all the damages ſuffered ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the War; or elſe, that each party should remain in poſſeſſion of what they actually poſſeſſed.</hi> Our Ambaſſador ſhewed him the miſtake in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning after ſuch a manner, and how far we were from being the Aggreſſors; he alſo Repreſented to him the impoſſibility of determining upon the choice of either of thoſe propoſals, till it had been firſt examined, when the War begun! how? and by whom; without which it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to underſtand the true Senſe of that propoſition. After that diſcourſe, our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador concluded that he had not power to treat, but an expreſs order to be gone immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But that however they might diſpatch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way an expreſs to inform Us of thoſe propoſals, which was in his opinion, the only way to come to a Peace, to which he knew of his own cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, I was altogether inclined. That was the end of an enterview, which they would needs have to paſs in the world for a Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of which all the blame, and ill ſucceſs has been imputed to Us. And ſince you repeat the ſame thing in your Letter, as a conſiderable
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:29562:214"/> advance for Peace, we have likewiſe right to make you the ſame anſwer now which our Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor made them at that time, namely, that 'tis impoſſible for us to explain our ſelves clearly concerning thoſe two propoſitions, till you have firſt explained the terms of them. In that view, we have accepted the Mediation of our dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the King of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> as we are ready to refer it to any other Prince, who ſhall not have declared himſelf a party againſt us, in hopes that by that means it may clearly appear, what conditions you deſire a Peace ſhould be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon; tho' you are not ignorant we have particularized ſeveral things about that Subject, as alſo ſeveral of your own people have done that are well affected to Peace, and to the good of their Country, that are at preſent proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe they ſuffered themſelves to be too eaſily perſwaded into a belief, that as to what concerns the aboveſaid propoſitions, you would take a reſolution to diſpatch ſome body to Us, to treat about proper means to procure a Peace, and to prevent the inconveniences that have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince.</p>
                  <p>As to the nomination of a Neuter place to treat of Peace with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> which are engaged in the preſent War, we ſay, that as we have no differences with the moſt Chriſtian King, but only ſo far as he has concerned himſelf in your quarrel, we doubt not but we may Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate our ſelves together by acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our true intereſts, which permits us not to ſuffer a good Correſpondence that has prevailed ſo long time together between us, and that Crown, ſhould be deſtroyed by the obſtinate refuſal to agree to juſt and reaſonable means to come to a Peace. As for the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who could not meddle in theſe diſputes without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the engagements he had equally both with you and Us, we cannot conſent with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:29562:215"/> to that Crown, to the Nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Neuter place. Nay we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to declare here that the enterprize made in the Haven of <hi>Bergen,</hi> would never have come into our thoughts, if that Prince had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Us by his ſollicitation to ſend our Fleet thither by the hopes he made us conceive of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together in the ſpoil of your ſhips. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever notwithſtanding the ſenſible outrages we have received from him on all occaſions that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves, we make no ſcruple to tell you, that as we accept the Mediation of our dear Brother, the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> as well in regard to <hi>France,</hi> as to your ſelves, ſo when our particular differences ſhall be compoſed, we will accept your Mediation to procure a Peace with <hi>Denmark</hi> upon reaſonable Conditions, and that with deſign to ſtrengthen the Union that ought to Reign between the Proteſtant Princes.</p>
                  <p>That therefore you may have no more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to entertain your people withal in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull opinion, that we refuſe to explain to you the conditions upon which we deſire a Peace, and tho' that manner of proceeding be quite out of Common uſe; namely, to outrage and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack in an open War your Allies and Neighbours, and then to demand of them afterwards what are their pretenſions, inſtead of offering them a juſt Reparation for the damages they have ſuffered, notwithſtanding the inconveniences that may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low therefrom we will not omit to let you know at the ſame time, what we would not have and what we pretend. We deſire not your State ſhould ſuffer the leaſt change, that the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by which you Reign over your people ſhould be in any manner weakened or altered, and much leſs yet, that you ſhould depend on any Prince neither do we pretend any other Empire over the Sea, but ſuch as our predeceſſors have at all times inconteſtably poſſeſs'd.</p>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:29562:215"/>
                  <p>We demand only, that you ſhould inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and in every point obſerve the laſt Treaty that was concluded between us, and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Declaration publiſht by your Governours in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> be ſuppreſs'd and diſavow'd, as contrary to the honour of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns and the common right of Nations; and that beſides ſuch a Regulation of Commerce may be eſtabliſht in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> that our Subjects may be ſecured from the inſults and oppreſſions to which they have at other times ſeen themſelves expoſed.</p>
                  <p>And tho' we propoſe not a Reimburſment in money to ſatisfie the immenſe charges of the War, yet we demand a moderate Sum in conſideration of the damages, and to indemnify us for the loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we and our Subjects have ſuffered, ſuch a one as ſhall be judged reaſonable; and moreover that ſecurity be given, that the ſaid Treaty ſhall be inviolably obſerved in all things as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators ſhall find agreeable to Reaſon and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                  <p>In fine, we expect that in order to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting ſo pious and important a work as is that of the Peace to be made between us, and which is to confirm and preſerve that of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, you ſhall depute ſome perſon to come to us to Regulate the Preliminaries that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to bring the Treaty to perfection. This being done we doubt not but God will protect us, and that he will turn all things to good, which will appear principally by reciprocal Teſtimonies of tenderneſs, and on our part by the continuation of the good will we always have had for your State; but if for particular reaſons, you reject this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and that you obſtinately perſiſt againſt your true intereſts to refuſe to accept the Peace that is put into your hands, I leave it to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to Judge, whether of us ought to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if the War continue, with the fatal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:29562:216"/> and terrible misfortunes that will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it, and whether we have not done on our ſide, all that our honour would permit us, to prevent them. I pray God ſo to diſpoſe your Hearts as to make ſerious Reflections upon the true intereſt of Proteſtants, and to conſider how much it will be expoſed to the rage of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies if the War continue. We Recommend you, High and Mighty Lords, to his holy and happy protection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <head>The States Anſwer to the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 14th. of <hi>October 1666.</hi>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WE have received your Majeſty's Anſwer da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Whitehall</hi> the 4th. of <hi>October</hi> Old Stile, or on the 14th. of <hi>October</hi> laſt, to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we writ you dated on the 16th. of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> and tho' at the very beginning of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, your Majeſty endeavours to juſtify your Arms againſt this State, we believe it to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to enter actually into any diſpute about that Subject, becauſe we are perſwaded that if your Majeſty would take the pains to peruſe the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:29562:216"/> that have formerly been delivered into the hands of your Miniſters, and that have been like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made publick, that you would be undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced, as well as all the World, of the Juſtice of our cauſe, and of the Motives that engaged us to our own defence.</p>
                  <p>As to the five points in the Concluſion of your Majeſty's ſaid anſwer, we are in a State to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt by the faith of men of Honour, that we have not violated the laſt Treaty in any of its parts, and that we will engage for the future, inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to obſerve the Peace, in caſe it be made, praying your Majeſty moreover, to ſet your ſelf at reſt in that reſpect, and to be pleaſed to give order, that it be punctually obſerved on your part.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond point, tho' your Majeſty's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and particularly Agent <hi>Selwyn,</hi> publiſhed upon the Coaſts of <hi>Africk</hi> a Declaration without Contradiction, more imperious, and injurious, than that which ours could have invented, and much leſs have put in execution, as has been made amply to appear elſewhere, yet we have ſilence thereupon, and we have not been obſerved to make any noiſe about it in the World. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to ſhew that we are ready to remove that obſtacle we conſent that the two aboveſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations ſhall be both diſannull'd and diſavow'd as well on your Majeſty's part, as on ours.</p>
                  <p>To the third, that we are no leſs inclin'd than your Majeſty, to conſent to a Regulation of Commerce, provided it be General and Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, being hardly able to conceive that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would refuſe in <hi>Europe</hi> and elſewhere, what you pretend to be Equitably your due in the Eaſt-<hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the fourth, that tho' we are ſo far from being in a Condition to conſent to a Re-imburſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the charges of the War, or the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages ſuffered by your Majeſty or your Subjects
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:29562:217"/> that on the contrary, we have right to pretend the reſtitutien of the Ships and effects of our good Subjects, ſtopt in the Harbors or upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of your Majeſties Kingdom, or that were taken at Sea by ſurprize, upon the Coaſts of <hi>England;</hi> as likewiſe of <hi>New-Holland, Cabo Corſo,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places taken in <hi>Africk,</hi> without publiſhing before hand any Declaration of War, and in the time when our ſaid Ships entred into your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Ports, truſting in the publick faith of a Treaty of Peace, in confidence in the ſincere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration which you had cauſed to be ſeveral times reiterated to us by your Miniſters that reſided then at the <hi>Hague,</hi> namely, that we ought not to take any umbrage at your Majeſty's Arming, nor in any manner to apprehend the meeting of any of your Majeſty's Ships of War, adding that your Majeſty ſhould always abhor the Conduct of the uſurper <hi>Cromwel</hi> towards us, and would never enterprize any thing againſt the Liberty of the State, and of its Subjects; but that if it ſhould happen that your Majeſty could receive no ſatisfaction upon the Complaints that ſhould be made to us on your part, that as a Generous Prince you would Declare War againſt the State, before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Act of Hoſtility were Committed. However it be, we ſhall be always ready to ſtand to the Terms of the ſaid Declaration, if any thing muſt be expected of us.</p>
                  <p>As to the fifth, which is that your Majeſty would make a Difficulty to truſt to our Word or Seal, tho' on our ſide we were ready to truſt to your Majeſty's, we ſhall readily agree to any other propoſition to render it the more firm and inviolable by the Guarantie of other Princes or States that are Friends or Allies.</p>
                  <p>But ſince your Majeſty teſtifies by your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer above annexed, that you have ſome grounds to hope to induce us to a particular Treaty, to the excluſion of our Allies, we find our ſelves
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:29562:217"/> obliged to advertiſe you, that that cannot be, and conſequently, it is abſolutely neceſſary in Order to come to a good Peace, that your Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to treat joyntly with us and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and that you muſt needs diſpoſe your ſelf to conſent that choice be made of a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place where the Plenipotentiaries as well of the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> as thoſe of your Majeſty may jointly with ours meet with all Liberty, without which all the pains that can be taken about it, will be to no purpoſe, becauſe we are reſolved to remain inſeparably linkt to our Allies, and to hearken to no propoſition that may tend to break our Union, directly or indirectly, and that with ſo much the more confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are fully perſwaded, our Allies will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main always unſhaken in the ſame mind. We therefore make ardent prayers to God, to be pleaſed to incline your Majeſty to a thing that is a Preliminary, without which 'tis impoſſible to come to a Peace; and we hope when affairs ſhall once be placed upon a good foot, we ſhall have new reaſons to redouble our Zeal, and to put up prayers for the proſperity of your Majeſty's reign.</p>

            <p>However all hopes of being able to effect a Peace that year vaniſht to nothing, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces began to labour vigorouſly in refit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and remanning out their Fleet. And for that end they reſolved to keep their Seamen in pay all winter that they might have their full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of men ready early in the Spring. For they thought it good Policy to make that laſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to oblige <hi>England</hi> to accept a Peace which they called juſt, by endeavouring to obtain by the force of Arms, or by ſubtilty of intrigue, what they could not effect by fair means.</p>

The firſt Step they made in that Affair was, to prevail with the King of <hi>England,</hi> to conſent to the naming of a Neuter Place, where the Plenipotentiaries of each Party might ſecurely meet in order to treat of a Peace. After much Pains taken in it, they obliged the States to write the following Letter about that Subject to the King of <hi>England.</hi> The Reſpect due to that Prince, obliged the States to make that firſt Advance, whilſt the Miniſters of <hi>Swedeland</hi> on the other ſide endeavoured their utmoſt to perſwade his Majeſty to grant their Demand.</p>

And we doubt not but your Majeſty, upon a ſerious Reflection thereon, will be of the ſame Mind with us. But that your Majeſty may not think we neglect any thing on our ſide, that may contribute to any thing that may be capable to advance ſo important a Work, and to give you the cleareſt Evidences imaginable of the Sincerity of our Intentions upon this Subject, we were willing to aſſure your Majeſty by theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, That the Inſtances we have made hitherto, to perſwade you to name a Neuter Place, does not at all concern our particular Intereſts; Nay, and we proteſt, That if that Affair concerned us in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, we would take Pride in paſſing by all Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, by heartily conſenting that our Differences might be terminated any where, whereſoever it ſhould pleaſe
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:29562:218"/> your Majeſty, not excepting <hi>England</hi> it ſelf. But becauſe by virtue of the Alliance in which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> it is impoſſible for us to act otherwiſe, we hope your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, will think good, that the Negotiation of the Treaty may be begun and perfected elſewhere than in the Dominions of your Majeſty. We have therefore thought fit, for the facilitating ſo Holy a Work, to pray your Majeſty by this Letter to conſider this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair as it is really at the Bottom, and at length to be pleaſed to let the Treaty be carried on in a Neuter-place, where the Plenipotentiaries of each Party may meet. And ſince we have ſufficiently explained our ſelves thereupon, if your Majeſty will but be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the ſincerity of our Sentiments, there is all Appearance, we ſhall ſoon ſee the End of a Work that is the Subject of the greateſt Hopes of our People, and of the Glory of the Princes intereſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

            <p>The <hi>Hague</hi> being thus choſen by the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> for the Negotiation of a Peace; the States, for particular Reaſons approved not that Choice, but writ again about that Subject, to pray him to be pleaſed to name another Place; repreſenting to him, That ſince his Majeſty upon the Inſtances made to him to perſuade him to conſent to a Neuter Place, had had the Goodneſs to do them the Honour to will that the Peace ſhould be treated on in their Country,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:29562:219"/> they aſſured themſelves, That his Majeſty would make no Difficulty to ſend his Miniſters to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht, Boiſleduc, Breda,</hi> &amp;c.

The Ambaſſadours of <hi>Swedeland</hi> perceiving that all thoſe Nicities of <hi>France</hi> were not at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable at that time, laboured ſo hard with that Court, that at laſt <hi>Breda</hi> was accepted, whither all the Plenipotentiaries being come, in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> the firſt Conference began in the Caſtle the 4th of <hi>June</hi> 1667.<note place="margin">

               <hi>English</hi> in their Harbours, but likewiſe to make a Deſcent ſome where to ravage the Country. For that effect they held a Council of War to conſult by what means they might run ſome light Frigats a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable way up the River, to go and burn the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Ships that were there. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de Gent</hi> was choſen for that Expedition, for which they gave him the Command of a Squadron formed out of the Detachments made from the Grand Fleet. It was compoſed of 6 Men of War, 1 Advice-yacht, and 2 Fireſhips of the Admiralty of the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> of 11 Men of War, 4 Advice-Yachts, and 2 Fireſhips of the Admiralty of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and 13 Galliots.

And for that effect a Detachment was made from the Fleet, of 17 Light Frigats, 5 Advice-yachts, ſome Galliots, and ſome Boats. That on the 19th, about 4 in the Morning, the Wind being turned about to the South-Weſt, they were forced to luff,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:29562:220"/> and afterwards conſtrained by that contrary Wind to caſt Anchor: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1667"/> But that the Wind chopping about at length to the South-Eaſt, was more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them; which made them reſolve to unmoor, without any further Loſs of Time, in Hopes to execute their Enterpriſe that ſame Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But the Wind ſlackning, they were forced to ſtop a Mile and a half ſhort of the <hi>Hope,</hi> which gave Time to the <hi>English</hi> Ships to eſcape away. However, to Day, <hi>continues he,</hi> about Noon, as the Tide begun to come in, we advanced as far as the Mouth of the River of <hi>Chattam.</hi> We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gave Order to the Land-Troops and Marine Soldiers to make a Deſcent, and to attack the Fort of <hi>Sheerneſs;</hi> In the mean while we advanced with our Men of War, and anchored before the ſame Fort.

                  </note> and ſome Fireſhips that were there, betook themſelves to Flight, and the Men in the Fort ran away likewiſe before our Troops got thither; ſo that after the Fort had been cannonaded about an Hour and an half, our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſcaled it to pull down from thence the <hi>English</hi> Banner.

            <p>On the 23d of <hi>June</hi> Mr. <hi>de Wit</hi> ſent ſome other Diſpatches to the States, to inform them of ſeveral remarkable Circumſtances, which were not before come to his Knowledge, and added thereto the ſequel of ſo many happy Progreſſes. He informed them, that the Bed of the River was ſo narrow, that there could but one Ship paſs along it abreaſt, and that the <hi>English</hi> fired ſo hotly from their Artillery, that none of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> durſt advance to go near them any more: But that Captain <hi>Brakel,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the College of the Admiralty of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> offering himſelf to that Service, made appear, that nothing is impoſſible to a great Courage. For tho' he commanded but a ſorry Frigat, ill manned and equipp'd, yet he undertook alone to go up and burn the <hi>English</hi> Men of War, ſo that being advanced with all imaginable Reſolution, without firing a Gun, he endured all the Enemies greateſt Fire. He was ſcarcely arrived within Musket ſhot of an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Man of War, but that he fired a Broad-ſide at her, and falling upon her at the ſame time, by the Favour of the Wind, grappled her and took her, with the Loſs only of 3 Men. A <hi>Dutch</hi> Fireſhip grappled likewiſe another <hi>English</hi> Man of War of 52 Guns and burnt her. That Diſaſter ſtruck ſuch a Conſternation into the Enemies, that a part of the <hi>Royal Charles</hi>'s Men fled away, and the reſt jumped into the Water. We took with the Help of our Boats, without any Reſiſtance, another <hi>English</hi> Ship, called <hi>Charles the Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th</hi> of 50 Guns, but being
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:29562:222"/> grappled by one of our Fire-Ships, ſhe blew up in the night. The ſhip call'd the Fort of <hi>Hunningen</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by her men that fled away in Boats was taken: ſhe carried 70 Braſs Guns; but ſhe was unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burnt contrary to the Orders we had given. This loſs was followed with that of another very conſiderable <hi>English</hi> Ship which we likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with the Flames. Yeſterday we percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved 3 more above us which we hope to deſtroy to day; the Water was ſo low that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to get up to them. However the North wind continuing to blow, and the reſt of our Fire-Ships that were ſcattered from the Flag being veer'd back again towards the Admiral, we gave them orders to go up and burn them. And tho' it ſeemed, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton Caſtle</hi> ſituated upon the River ſide, might have oppoſed that enterprize, becauſe the paſſage being very narrow in that place, our men muſt have been forced to have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red its fire, yet in ſpite of all thoſe obſtacles, the buſineſs was carried on with ſo much prudence, that we burnt them to day about 3 in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. Thoſe 3 Ships were the moſt conſiderable in all the <hi>English</hi> Navy, they were named <hi>the Loyal London, the Royal James,</hi> and <hi>the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Oak.</hi> Mr. <hi>de Wit</hi> adds in the cloſe, We have obtained, ſays he, all theſe Glorious advantages hitherto without the loſs of above 150 men. We are at preſent reſolved to go down the River, to join the Main Body of our Fleet. According to the advices we have, all the Kingdom is in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, and they are there Aſſembling a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Troops; But all that is not able to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midate us. However becauſe moſt of our Fire-Ships have been ſpent, we pray the States to give Order that we may have more. All our Officers both General and Inferiour have Signaliz'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and given proofs of an unparallelled Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Aylva</hi>'s Squadron, has joined the Admiral's Flag, ſo that the Fleet is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:29562:222"/> with a Conſiderable Number of Ships of War, and we have nothing more to do but to put up prayers for the continuation of the proſperities with which it has pleaſed God hitherto to bleſs the Arms of the State.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> and General <hi>Monk</hi> were the melancholick Spectatours of the Expedition, and according to the report of ſome Priſoners, they had been but the day before on Board thoſe 3 Ships that were laſt burnt. Retiring to <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> they were in an unconceivable vexation, to ſee the Fineſt and Richeſt Ships of all their Fleet deſtroyed ſo ſtrangely, and they in no Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to put a ſtop to thoſe terrible Ravages of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> There were ſeveral other Ships and Fire-Ships likewiſe loſt, which the <hi>English</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſunk in the River of <hi>Chattam,</hi> on purpoſe to ſtop the <hi>Hollanders</hi> paſſage, and beſides them were loſt 8 of the moſt conſiderable men of War in the whole <hi>English</hi> Fleet: Which made both Court and Country exclaim againſt thoſe pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Councellors that had adviſed the King to be amuſed ſo far with the hopes of a Peace, as to venture to treat without Sword in hand, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo great a Victory as he had had the laſt time over the <hi>Dutch</hi> to be perſwaded under pretence of ſaving Money, not to put his Fleet out, when it was ſo neceſſary for the obtaining an advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Peace, and of preſerving the Honour and Reputation the Nation had gotten at ſo dear an expence in two conſecutive <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars, which now was by one of the greateſt overſights ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable in Policy obſcured and tarniſht all at one blaſt, and never ſince recovered it ſelf altogether to its former Luſter.</p>
            <p>Thoſe ſurprizing and heavy miſchiefs much A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed and imbittered the people. So that an inſurrection was feared in <hi>Kent,</hi> and about <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter.</hi> Upon which the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monk</hi> apprehending leaſt thoſe glowing Sparks
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:29562:223"/> might if not timely quencht kindle into an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conflragation that might endanger the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, thought it beſt to ſtifle them in time by ſending with ſpeed a good Body of Troops both Horſe and Foot, down to the Coaſts, as well to awe the Mutinous People as to oppoſe the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> However the whole Storm of the publick diſcontent fell afterwards upon Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>Hyde,</hi> as being the reputed Author of thoſe Counſels that were ſuppoſed to have cauſed all thoſe ill ſucceſſes, ſo that he was forced to flie into Exile, to avoid a worſe deſtiny, from which the King his Maſter could not have protected him without expoſing himſelf to the extreameſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. In the mean while the Common Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People in <hi>Holland</hi> was, that theſe new attempts inſtead of diſpoſing the States to a Peace would have kindled fiercer flames of War, and have made the two Nations irreconcilable; But experience quickly ſhew'd the contrary the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for Peace at <hi>Breda,</hi> was thereupon all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den further advanced than it had been in many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences before.</p>
            <p>On the 25th. of the Month, it was reſolved in a Council of War held on board the Fleet, to detach away Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de Gent</hi> with a Squadron of 22 Sail of Men of War and Fire-Ships, towards the North, as well to endeavour to ſeize upon the Iſle of <hi>Hitland,</hi> as to cruize for the Ships that were expected from the Eaſt-<hi>Indies.</hi> But as for <hi>De Ruiter</hi> with the Reſt of the Fleet, they went and Anchoured before the Iſle of <hi>Sheppey,</hi> where they Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Four or Five hundred men, who advanced into the Country without Reſiſtance, and brought off to the Fleet, a great quantity of Refreſhments of all ſorts.</p>
            <pb n="431" facs="tcp:29562:223"/>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Hoorn</hi> was afterwards ſent with his Regiment on board the Fleet, and <hi>de Ruiter</hi> received orders, to remount the <hi>Thames,</hi> in order to attempt ſome further enterprize. For which effect, Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi> who was newly come to the Fleet with a Reinforcement of ſome Ships from <hi>Zealand,</hi> was Commanded with a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of 14 of the lighteſt Ships, and 2 Fire-Ships to advance near <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and do all the miſchief he could. But that new enterprize had no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but only ſerved to augment the conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was already among the inhabitants of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe the <hi>English</hi> had ſunk ſo many Ships to ſtop up the paſſage of the <hi>Thames,</hi> that it was impoſſible for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to make any advance; and beſides the Batteries of Great Cannon that were raiſed all along on both ſides the River fired ſo hotly upon the Ships that ventured within their reach, that <hi>Bankert</hi> was forced to retire, and veer back towards the Admiral.</p>
            <p>The Fleet then having been Reinforced by the Troops brought by the Count <hi>de Hoorn,</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals thought fit to attack the Fort near <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> the principal Circumſtances of which Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are Related in the Letter Mr. <hi>de Wit</hi> writ concerning it to the States, of which here follows the extract.</p>

Things being thus order'd, we cauſed Vice Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> to advance with <hi>14</hi> men of War, <hi>1</hi> Advice Yacht, and two fire-Ships, to attack the fort on one ſide, which Squadron was divided into two Parts. And Rear Admiral <hi>Van Nes</hi> had order to enter the Bay with <hi>6</hi> men of War, to approach nearer the fort, whilſt Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> ſhould vigorouſly attack it on another ſide. When the ſignal was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Troops were tranſported to ſhore in Boats and Galliots, with all imaginable ſpeed. Obſerving, that Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> who was to attackt the fort before, kept at too great a diſtance from the Ramparts, and that Rear-Admiral <hi>Van Nes</hi> went not into the Haven, as had been projected, we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and I, to go up to them, and make them advance. But when we came there, we found it impoſſible for Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> to get any nearer, and upon the Report made to us by the Soldiers we ſent to <hi>Van Nes,</hi> that there was no going in on that ſide, the Boom being cut, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſend in ſome Boats to ſound the paſſage, but the Tide going off, and a Calm coming on, it was impoſſible to execute any thing. <hi>Evertſz</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The body of Foot that was poſted to guard the paſſage was vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attackt by the Enemies Horſe and Foot, but were received ſo briskly by them, that after a long and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate fight, they were forced to retire with loſs.</p>
               <p>That attempt having thus failed, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced higher up the River and made the Ships of his fleet beſpread the whole breadth of it that they quite blockt up its paſſage. Rear-Admiral <hi>Vander Zaan</hi> was ordered to stay with <hi>8</hi> men of War, at the mouth of the Harbour of <hi>Harwich,</hi> to obſerve the Enemies Ships coming or going to and from the Northward, and Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſz,</hi> and <hi>Star</hi> were ſent towards the <hi>North-Foreland,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from coming in on that ſide.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In the mean while this ſtrange and indirect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the States Forces made a great change in the Negotiation for Peace that was managing at <hi>Breda.</hi> For the States Plenipotentiaries ſtuck not to ſay, <hi>That the advantages their Arms had newly obtained, might perhaps make their Maſters alter their minds; That however they conſented to conclude a Peace upon the conditions that had been preſented, but that they could not anſwer for its Ratification. And that it was not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the States and their Allies ſhould ſtand to the offers that had been made, if God cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nued to bleſs their Arms with new Conqueſts.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> Aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by that Declaration, to oblige the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:29562:225"/> make choice of one or the other of the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that had been made them, <hi>viz.</hi> That each party ſhould either render back Reciprocally what they had taken or elſe keep on both ſides what they had. And the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries appeared likewiſe much more inclinable to Peace than they had done before, and the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as well with the States, as with the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> were at laſt terminated on the 10th. of <hi>July;</hi> ſave only that Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> one of His <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty's Plenipotentiaries was obliged to go back with all ſpeed to <hi>London</hi> to get ſome points agreed to, which it was not in their power to decide.</p>
            <p>The news of a Concluſion of the Peace was brought to the Fleet the 14th. of the ſame month, and yet becauſe it was not fully ratified, ſuch was then the inſolence of the then <hi>Loveſtenian</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for which they afterwards paid dear, that orders were ſent for all that, next day to <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> to continue ſtill to do all the miſchief he could upon the <hi>English</hi> Coaſts, becauſe the Peace was not yet fully concluded. Upon that advice the Fleet was divided the ſame day into 2 Squadrons, whereof 1 under the Command of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes,</hi> was ordered to block up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of <hi>de Ruiter</hi> in perſon Quitted the <hi>Thames</hi> to go a cruizing along the Channel to infeſt the ſeveral Ports of the Kingdom there.</p>
            <p>On the 18th <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Squadron paſſed the Strait of <hi>Callis,</hi> and the next day advanced right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Singels</hi> without meeting any Ship. But the <hi>English Barbado's</hi> and <hi>Smirna</hi> Fleets which they had flattered themſelves with the hopes of taking, were got ſafe into Port before they could reach them. Seeing then they had miſt their deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red prey, they reſolved next to attack <hi>Torbay,</hi> where there were 2 Merchant Ships. Which enterprize
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:29562:225"/> put all the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> ſo much the more in alarm, becauſe <hi>de Ruiter</hi> having divided his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron into ſeveral bodies, made them appear in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places at one time, which ſo perplext the <hi>English</hi> that they knew not which way to bend their Force to hinder a deſcent. On the 8th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> having received a Reinforcement of 7 men of War, and 8 Fire-Ships, he ſailed as far as <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> upon advice he had received that a good Number of <hi>English</hi> men of War were there aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling. The next day towards evening, a Boat came out of <hi>Plymouth</hi> carrying a White Flag, which came directly to <hi>de Ruiter</hi> to tell him the News of a Peace. There were in it two <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Colonels accompanied with two other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who came on board the Admiral, and told him that Peace was Concluded between <hi>England,</hi> and the United Provinces; after which they made him great proteſtations of Amity, praying him to order all Acts of Hoſtility to ceaſe. They complained at the ſame time of the fight that had newly hapned on the <hi>Thames</hi> between Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes,</hi> and ſome of the King's Ships; and how that, contrary to the Peace, many of their Ships had been endamaged, and ſeveral Fire-Ships burnt to Aſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>de Ruiter</hi> without taking any notice of all thoſe Compliments, thought not fit to diſcontinue his Enterprize as believing the States would not have failed to have informed him of ſo great a piece of News, if things had been really ſo as the <hi>English</hi> pretended.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes</hi> having received orders from the States, to remount the River of <hi>London</hi> and to go and attack the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men of War and Fire-Ships that were in the <hi>Hope,</hi> and to keep the <hi>English</hi> in a perpetual alarm, ſet ſail accordingly with his Squadron, on the 2d. of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> and found there Admiral <hi>Spragg</hi> with 5 Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, 17 Fire-Ships, and a great many ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. The principal Circumſtances of the fight
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:29562:226"/> that hapned between them on that occaſion, are Related in the following Letter written by Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Admiral <hi>Van Meppelen,</hi> who led the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard.</p>

                  </note>UPon the advice we had, that 5 of the King's Frigats whereof the biggeſt carried 54 Guns, 16 or 18 Fire-Ships, and a good Number of ſmall Veſſels were riding a little below <hi>Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi> we reſolved to go and attack them. I led the Van, and Captain <hi>Naalhout</hi> was Commanded with 8 Fire-Ships, to go and begin the attack. I following him cloſe with five men of War, and was backed by Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes.</hi> At our approach the Enemies hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Sails, and ſtaid in their poſt till we came near their Fire-Ships that were at Anchor; we preſt them ſo cloſely, that ſome of them in a fit of deſpair, cut their Anchor-Cables and retired towards the King's Frigats who likewiſe began to flie. Captain <hi>Naalhout</hi> fell upon them with ſo much Courage, that he forced them to veer back towards their Fire-Ships who encloſed them ſo round, and kept ſo cloſe to them, that it was Difficult to come near any of them. Then a Calm coming on, the ſmall <hi>English</hi> Veſſels fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo many ſhot at our Fire-Ships, that we were forced to quit ſome of them, after we had ſet fire to them, and there were two of them ſet on fire and burnt by the Guns of the <hi>English.</hi> But as ſoon as the Wind began to riſe a little they all betook themſelves to flight, and we cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them as far as under the very Fort of <hi>Graveſend</hi> which fired fiercely upon us, with its Cannon. We Anchored with our whole Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron in the ſame place from which we had chaſed them, and we loſt in that Action 11 Fire-Ships, ſo that there was but one left us, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt 7.</p>

               <p>On the next day being the 3d. of <hi>August,</hi> we perceived the Enemies coming down the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and making towards us. We therefore quitted our poſt, and as we were retiring, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the only Fire-Ship we had left, run a ground and that it was impoſſible to ſave it, we ſet it on fire towards Evening. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready got very near us with their Fire-Ships; we received them vigorouſly, and both ſides conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued firing at one another, till we caſt Anchor, and then the <hi>English</hi> quitted us.

However, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> left not off following us, in Hopes to burn the firſt of our Ships that ſhould have run aground; But we gave them chace again about the dusk of the Evening.</p>
               <p>On the 5th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the morning, we deſcried 21 Sail making towards us with a freſh Eaſt-North-Eaſt Gale, which we eaſily diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the <hi>English</hi> come out of <hi>Harwich.</hi> They had 5 Frigats, 14 Fire-Ships, and 2 Galliots. Whereupon Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes</hi> held a Council, and it was reſolved we ſhould caſt Anchor, and manfully to ſtand the Enemies ſhock, in ſpite of the danger we expoſed our ſelves to of loſing ſome Ships. As ſoon as they got near enough to us, the firſt motion they made, was to come and fall upon Captain <hi>Naalhout</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to burn him; but he haſtily weighing up his Anchor, vigorouſly Repulſed two Fire-Ships that were coming to grapple him, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped as 'twere by Miralce.

            <p>The Number of Fire-Ships that were deſtroyed as well on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſide, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near equal.

               <note place="margin">The Trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple League.</note> and the United Provinces entred into a ſtrict Alliance together, at the beginning of the Year 1668. The States fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, that <hi>France</hi> would not fail to conceive an Umbrage at it, and that Ambitious Crown being Jealous at all the precautions taken by thoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers for their own ſecurity, might afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps endeavour to ſeek its Revenge upon ſome of them, thought it neceſſary to ſecure themſelves from that danger, by Uniting themſelves more ſtrictly with <hi>England</hi> which they did by a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:29562:228"/> Alliance with Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> Ambaſſador from his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty at the <hi>Hague.</hi> The firſt good effect that Tripple-Alliance produced, was to put a ſtop to the rapid Courſe of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations of <hi>France</hi> in the Low-Countries, by ſetting bounds to its Ambition.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>French</hi> King knew ſo well how to make his advantage of the late War between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which he had fomented for his own ends, that he took that opportunity, to ſurprize the weak <hi>Spaniards</hi> then under an infant King, and to wreſt ſeveral important places from them in the Low-Countries, contrary to the Faith of the Treaties on foot between the two Crowns. But the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Alliance forced him to lay down his Arms, ſo that on the 2d. of <hi>May,</hi> a Peace was Concluded between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Aix la Chappelle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that, the <hi>French</hi> King being much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at the Conduct of the States, never left off to ſeek out occaſion to ſhew his fierce Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The firſt ſtep he thought fit to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, was to endeavour to break the Famous, and by him ſo much dreaded Tripple-Alliance, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Princes that were engag'd in it. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull Ravages and Spoils the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had ſo unfairly committed on the <hi>English</hi> Coaſts, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Chattam,</hi> at a time of a Treaty of Peace, as likewiſe ſome new difficulties about Navigation and Commerce, furniſht him with a hopefull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, enough to work withal upon the King of <hi>England;</hi> there wanted only a dextrous Perſon to be choſen that might be fit to perſwade his <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannick</hi> Majeſty. And as the <hi>French</hi> have always been ſucceſsfull in employing the Miniſtery of Females in their moſt important Negotiations, becauſe they are more inſinuating, and flatter generally with a more powerfull and irreſiſtible influence than men; ſo accordingly the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> Siſter to that Prince, was pitcht upon to paſs to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> to manage that nice affair. She ſet out
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:29562:228"/> then in the month of <hi>June</hi> 1670,<note place="margin">1670.</note> accompanied with a great many <hi>French</hi> Lords, under pretence of making a viſit to the King her Brother. The States were not long before they perceived what blow the <hi>French</hi> were deſigning at them. For they well enough foreſaw that the Voyage of the Dutcheſs was intended only to break the Trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-League; And they had certain Advice, that the <hi>French</hi> King was preparing to march with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull Army towards <hi>Dunkirk</hi> early in the Spring; beſides all that, they made no Difficulty to ſay publickly at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> that if the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould attack the United Provinces upon any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence than that of the Triple League, that <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would not be obliged to aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Court, without declaring themſelves openly had already begun to Commit a ſort of Hoſtility, by laying exceſſive impoſts upon all <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchandizes imported into that Kingdom. The States having Complained of it ſeveral times with no effect, reſolved at laſt to retaliate that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, by forbidding the importing any Brandy or <hi>French</hi> Manufactures into their Dominions, hoping by that means to oblige the moſt Chriſtian King to alter his proceedings. And becauſe the march of the <hi>French</hi> Army towards <hi>Dunkirk</hi> put them in ſome apprehenſion for the Low-Countries, the States reſolved alſo to have a powerfull Fleet at Sea under the Command of Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> both to ſecure their Commerce, and to obſerve the motions of the <hi>French.</hi> And beſides they Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited <hi>England</hi> likewiſe to put a Fleet to Sea, to joyn with theirs, according to the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Tripple-League: But King <hi>Charles</hi> gave them already to underſtand, that he had quite different aims.</p>
            <pb n="442" facs="tcp:29562:229"/>
            <p>On the 8th. of <hi>June</hi> 1671. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1671"/> 
               <hi>de Ruiter</hi> ſailed out of the <hi>Menſe</hi> with ſome men of War, towards <hi>Oſtend,</hi> near which place, his Fleet was to Rendeſvouz. It conſiſted of 46 men of War, 10 Advice-Yachts, and 6 Fire-Ships. It carried 2379 Guns, 8090 Seamen, and 2768 Soldiers; and was divided into 3 Squadrons, the firſt under the immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> the ſecond under that of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Admiral <hi>Bankert,</hi> and the third under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>de Gent.</hi> Whilſt the Fleet was cruizing upon the Coaſts of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> it was on the 20th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a violent Tempeſt, by which ſeveral Ships were endamaged, and that of Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was one of the worſt treated. Two days after, he went and Anchored near <hi>Weſtkappel,</hi> to Repair and Refit his ſhattered Ships; from whence he diſcovered a Yacht, called the <hi>Merlin,</hi> which carried the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Flag on her Main-Maſt-Top. She was come out of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> and going back for <hi>England,</hi> and as ſhe paſſed throw the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet ſhe ſaluted <hi>de Ruiter</hi> with ſome Guns, but he being buſy in Refiting his Ship, could not make uſe of his Guns to anſwer his ſalute. Lieutenant-Admiral <hi>de Gent</hi> perceiving it, rendred the King's Yacht the Honours due to her with a ſalute of 7 Guns: And in the mean while Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> having made haſt to get his ready, ſaluted likewiſe with 9 Guns; but the <hi>English</hi> made him no return. At the ſame time ſetting Sail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, he ſummoned on board him all the General Officers and Captains of the fleet to inform him what damage they had ſuffered by the late ill Weather. And then it was that Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Admiral <hi>de Gent</hi> told him, that after he had returned his ſalute to the Kings Yacht, the <hi>English</hi> Captain fired twice at him with Bullets, becauſe he refuſed to ſtrike his Flag; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſent his Captain on Board the Yacht to know of the Commander the reaſons that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:29562:229"/> him to act in that manner, and that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Madam <hi>Temple</hi> was on board her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had had the honour to viſit her at her lodging at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where ſhe had treated him with great civilities, he was minded to go on board the Yacht himſelf to pay her his Reſpects; and that as he went in, he told the Captain ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry civilly, That as for an affair of ſo great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance as that was, to ſtrike his Flag to one of the King's Yachts, upon their own Coaſts, truely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Expreſs Order, he durſt not do it, but that if his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty had reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any ſuch thing, the difference ought to be decided between his Majeſty and the States; and that after that diſcourſe, they parted good friends, Notwithſtanding which, that Rencounter by the <hi>French</hi> was made the Subject of ſo much noiſe and bluſtring in <hi>England,</hi> that the States found they had reaſon to apprehend very miſchievous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences from it.</p>
            <p>The Campaign the moſt Chriſtian King was to make near <hi>Dunkirk</hi> having ended in a bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of his Army; The States thought the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> low-Countries had nothing to fear that year, and therefore they reſolved to call home their Fleet, to prevent the Tempeſts that begun alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to reign. And accordingly Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had orders to retire on the 21ſt. of <hi>September</hi> and the 23d of the ſame month, the Fleet went into Port, to be Diſarmed and laid up.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the deſigns <hi>France</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> begun to break out, as likewiſe the intelligence the King of <hi>England</hi> had with that Crown; And the States were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from good hands, what Springs the <hi>French</hi> King had ſet on work to break the Triple League, and that to induce King <hi>Charles</hi> to break out or it, he promiſed to put into the field an Army of 100000 men, and to ſet out to Sea a Fleet of 40 Sail of men of War. But however the <hi>English</hi> on
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:29562:230"/> their ſide to lull aſleep the States, gave them good words.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the Year 1672, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1672"/> the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about the <hi>Merlin</hi> Yacht was revived again. And Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> was ſent to the <hi>Hague</hi> from his <hi>British</hi> Majeſty, to make Complaint of it, and to demand Reparation; adding, that Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Admiral <hi>de Gent</hi> ought to be puniſht. And tho' the 19th. Article of the Treaty at <hi>Breda, That men of War, or Merchants Ships belonging to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, when they ſhall meet any of the King of</hi> England's <hi>Ships of War in the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Seas, ſhall be obliged to ſtrike their Flag, and lower their main Topſails as was formerly practiſed</hi> Yer Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> would needs maintain, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Commiſſioners appointed to treat with him, that the buſineſs of the Flag was not to be taken from the Treaty of <hi>Breda,</hi> but from an Ancient right; and that the civilities they rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one another, were all times to be Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some days after, he delivered in a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wherein it was aſſerted, <hi>That the Empire of the Sea belonged to the</hi> Engliſh: <hi>That not only every ſingle Ship was obliged to ſtrike their Flag, but even whole Fleets: That Lieutenant Admiral</hi> de Gent <hi>had failed in his Duty, and ought to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,</hi> &amp;c. All the Reaſons the States could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, would not ſatisfie Sir <hi>George Downing,</hi> nor ſtop his haſty departure.</p>
            <p>The States likewiſe employed all imaginable means to ſatisfy the <hi>French</hi> King, but that Prince had taken ſo ſtrong a Reſolution to make War, that nothing was able to divert him from it. Whereupon the States ſeeing plainly, that all thoſe Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were making againſt the United Provinces, and that the <hi>Netherlands</hi> were going to be made the Theater of a terrible War, they begun to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves, by raiſing a Fund to defray the vaſt expences they were like to be engaged in. And
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:29562:230"/> after deliberations, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Captain General of the Armies of the State the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> upon certain conditions not neceſſary to be inſerted here. The States having enjoyed Peace by Land near 24 years, their Land-Forces were ſo accuſtomed to Idleneſs, that they were not like the ſame men; and too long a reſt had effeminated the Spirits of the Soldiers, that there was no Reliance to be made upon their Service. Therefore Orders were given for new Levies and endeavours were uſed to make Alliances with the Neighbouring Princes for <hi>Auxiliary</hi> Troops. They uſed all diligence to fit out a Fleet of 48 Capital men of War, and 24 Fire-Ships, beſides Galliots and other ſmall Tenders; which Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was afterwards conſiderably Augmented.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>English</hi> put out a Fleet of 38 men of War, divided into three Squadrons; and the States Agent named <hi>de Clarges,</hi> having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that their deſign was to go and meet, and attack the <hi>Dutch Smirna</hi> Fleet, one of the richeſt they ever had yet, uſed his beſt Policy to diſappoint the <hi>English;</hi> and for that effect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd away ſeveral Galliots from <hi>Callis,</hi> to go and give the <hi>Smirna</hi> men notice of it in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Seas; ſo that upon that Advice, they took their Precautions for their own defence. They were to the Number of 72 ſail, including among them 6 men of War, that were their Convoy. When they were come as far as the middle of the Channel a Squadron of 9 <hi>English</hi> Frigats,<note place="margin">The <hi>Dutch Smirna</hi> Fleet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>

            <p>On the 24th. of <hi>March.</hi> At the ſight of the <hi>English,</hi> the Merchant Fleet threw themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the form of a <hi>Creſcent,</hi> and maintained the fight ſo vigorouſly for ſome hours, that Sir <hi>Robert Holms</hi> was forced to retire from them toward night but the next day having received a Reinforcement of 4 or 5 men of War more, he came up with them again, and charged them a freſh, but with no

But the main body of that Merchant Fleet, got in at length ſafe into the Ports of <hi>Holland.</hi> The Captains, <hi>de Nes</hi> and <hi>de Haas,</hi> who commanded there in chief, loſt their lives there, and Captain <hi>du Bois</hi> had his Left hand ſhot off</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King Declared War againſt the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Provinces the ſame day. The pretence of which Declaration was, <hi>That the diſpleaſure his Majeſty had received from the Conduct of the States General of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces for ſome time paſt towards him, was come to ſuch a height, that his Majeſty could no longer diſſemble his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, without prejudice to his Glory, and that a proceeding ſo very unſuitable to the great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the States had to his Majeſty, and to other Kings his predeceſſors, had at laſt provoked him to take a Reſolution to make War againſt them by Sea and Land,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The motives that induced the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> and Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> to joyn with <hi>France</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in a War againſt the States, were not much better founded then thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> King.

            <p>The United Provinces then ſeeing themſelves thus without any ſecond, and all alone engaged in a danger of a very fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="447" facs="tcp:29562:231"/> their Country with a very Numerous and well diſciplined Army, took Town after Town without Reſiſtance; whilſt the Biſhop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> attackt the States on another ſide, and finding the places open, were no leſs Victorious than their Great Allie. In fine, ſuch was the rapidity of their progreſſes, that of ſeven Provinces, three were already fallen into the hands of the Enemies; And if the affairs of the United Provinces had ſucceeded ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ill at Sea, as they had done at Land, it may be ſaid, that in all humane appearance, they had been ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrievably loſt. For after ſuch great loſſes, what could they expect but a Total Ruine? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Events do but indirectly concern our Subject, and that they have been already very largely and fully related by ſeveral Hiſtorians, we ſhall leave them to return to ſpeak only of the Actions that hapned at Sea.</p>
            <p>They had wrought with ſo much diligence in arming out the Fleet in <hi>Holland,</hi> that it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the 9th. of <hi>May,</hi> to ſet ſail. And the vigilence and care of Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> and Penſionary <hi>de Wit,</hi> contributed very much to that ſucceſsfull advance. It ſet ſail then under the Conduct of Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and <hi>Cornelius de Wit.</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the States, conſiſting of 67 ſail, which Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was ſoon was ſoon after Augmented, by a Reinforcement of ſeveral Ships more. On the 14th. day of the ſame month, the two Fleets of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> joined likewiſe near the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> And the ſame day the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet ſailed towards the Coaſts of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> where they Anchored till the 7th. of <hi>June</hi> being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed then of 91 men of War, 44 Fire-Ships, and 23 Advice-Yachts, making in all, 158 ſail. Then weighing Anchor they arrived at break of day at <hi>Solbay.</hi> The Confederate Fleets that were above 100 ſail ſtrong of men of War, had as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Relations Repreſent things, ſeveral times

But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered themſelves, preſented them ſo unexpectedly and ſuddenly before the bay, that ſeveral of the Enemies Ships were forced to cut their Anchor-Cables to get out to range themſelves timely in a Line of Battle.<note place="margin">A fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ets.</note> The two Royal Fleets were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe divided into three Squadrons. The Duke of <hi>York,</hi> as Lord High Admiral of the Kingdom, had the Command of the main Battle, or of the Red Squadron; The Count <hi>d' Etrees</hi> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>France</hi> Commanded the Right Wing, or the White Squadron; and Admiral <hi>Mountague</hi> Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> had the Conduct of the Left Wing, or Blue Squadron. Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to attack the Red Squadron; Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi> the White, and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Admiral <hi>de Gent</hi> the Blue one. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> advanced his Squadron, and came up and poſted himſelf within Piſtol ſhot Right againſt the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and fired a broadſide at him, which he returned again with the like. The two Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals continued thundring at one another, with continual diſcharges for about 2 hours, till they were both much ſhattered. But at laſt, the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Flag, with the main Top-Maſt to which it was faſtned, being ſhot down, he was forced to remove, and put up his Flag in another Ship, called the <hi>London.</hi> Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes,</hi> ſeconded by ſome other Ships, made right up to the Vice-Admiral of the Red; both of them kept with their head to the North in charging: But a Calm coming on, they could make no more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with any advantage to themſelves. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they continued firing at one another all the while without intermiſſion. The <hi>Royal Catharine</hi> an 80 Gun Ship, Commanded by Captain <hi>Chich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> falling near <hi>Van Nes</hi>'s Ship, he gave order to his men to ſeize and take her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For at the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the battle, whilſt the Wind continued to blow ſtill a ſoft Gale, coming out of <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Squadron, followed by a Fire ſhip, he tackt to the Northward, and fell upon the Earl of <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> Admiral of the Blue Squadron: He made up to him without firing ſo much as one Gun, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the furious diſcharges of his Enemy, and of ſeveral other <hi>English</hi> Ships that were about him. And when he was got very near the <hi>Royal James</hi> he fired a whole broadſide at her ſo effectually, that a moment after there was nothing to be heard from her but the lamentable cries of a great Number of poor wounded wretches not to ſpeak of thoſe that were killed with ſhot or ſplinters. But that which ſets of the Glory of that Action with ſo much the more Luſtre, is, that <hi>Brakel</hi>'s Ship, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Grand Holland,</hi> carried not above 300 men, and 62 Guns, whereas the <hi>Royal James</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried above 104, and 1000 men ſo that this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the other appeared but like a ſmall Boat. Yet <hi>Brakel</hi> attackt her ſo vigorouſly, and fired ſo furiouſly for half an hour into the very heart of the Enemies Ship, that according to wheat Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Mountague</hi> himſelf ſaid, he would have yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Brakel,</hi> if he had born a Flag. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de Gent</hi>'s Squadron had begun likewiſe to engage, and ſome of his Ships advanced like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and fell upon Admiral <hi>Mountague;</hi> he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already repulſed and ſunk 3 Fire-Ships, found himſelf ſo overwhelmed by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> that he could not hold out any longer.

But to return to <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi>'s Ship, a fourth Fire-ſhip falling upon him, Grapled him ſo faſt, that his Ship was ſoon burnt to Aſhes. The Seamen jumpt Pell-Mell into the Sea. And <hi>Mountague</hi> himſelf with two of his Sons being entred into a Boat in hopes to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhe was in a trice filled ſo full of men, and overcharged, that ſhe ſunk; ſo that Admiral <hi>Mountague</hi> or the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> that had been ſo Famous, unfortunately periſht there with two of his Sons. His body was taken up among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dead men, and carried to <hi>London,</hi> where it was interred with great Honour and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſide, Lieutenant Admiral <hi>de Gent,</hi> was not much more Fortunate than Admiral <hi>Mountague:</hi> For being extreamly Irritated againſt the <hi>English</hi> ever ſince the buſineſs of the <hi>Merlin</hi> Yacht, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would needs have had him puniſht by the States, he advanced and fell into the Blue Squadron with ſo much Fury and Undaunted Reſolution, that he cauſed much Terrour and Diſorder among them: but he had hardly fought half an hour, when he was taken off by a Cannon-Bullet. His Death was reſented as a great loſs to the United Provinces as well for the great Services he had rendred, as for thoſe he might ſtill have rendred them. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Panhuiſen</hi> that Commanded under him on board his Ship, took his time to inform <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and <hi>de Wit,</hi> without any noiſe of his Death. He was ordered to make no words of it, and in the mean while, to act with his Ship what was moſt requiſite for the Service of the State: But as he was worthily acquitting himſelf of his Employ he had the misfortune to have one of his Legs ſhot off.</p>

            <p>Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi> of <hi>Zealand</hi> attackt ſo vigorouſly the White Squadron, Compoſed moſt of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, that the Count <hi>de Eſtrees</hi> who Commanded it, having, as 'tis thought, ſecret orders not to fight, tackt away to the South-ward, which motion ſeparated the <hi>French</hi> from the <hi>English,</hi> whom they had a mind to leave in the Lurch; which ſeparation <hi>Bankert</hi> taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of, purſued them cloſe, firing continually at them, but the <hi>French</hi> would not be perſwaded to make any ſtand to face them, but continued to retreat till the night came on, and then they begun downright to flie, and to make all the ſail they could towards the Channel.</p>
            <p>There were performed many brave actions on that memorable day as well by the <hi>English</hi> as the <hi>Dutch.</hi> A great <hi>English</hi> Ship of 70 Guns was burnt by a Fire-Ship, two more of the firſt Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes were ſunk, and there were two more deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:29562:234"/> rapid Progreſſes and terrible depredations of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Land-Armies on their Frontiers. For at the very beginning of <hi>June,</hi> no leſs than 3 Armies, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>France,</hi> of the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and of the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> entred their Country, and attackt them on every ſide at the ſame time. And <hi>Orſoy, Bunick, Weſel,</hi> and <hi>Rynburg,</hi> were all taken in four days without any Reſiſtance. The <hi>French</hi> King adding Conqueſt to Conqueſt entred eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day further and further into the Country, and puſht on his ambitious deſigns with ſo much the greater Rapidity, becauſe all gave way before him by an unparallelled fatality. And it may be ſaid, that if the Confederate Fleets had been as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull, as their Land-Armies, the States had been loſt without retrieve, and the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces would have been forced to ſubmit to the Yoke of thoſe Foreign Powers that then attackt them with ſo much fury; but by reaſon that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet fought not at all, and that the <hi>English</hi> truſting on their aſſiſtance did not employ their full Naval ſtrength, and that Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> by his vigilance, had ſurprized them at a diſadvantage, when they little dreamt of him, in that he hindred them thereby from gaining a Victory over him, that ſucceſs was to him and the <hi>Dutch</hi> at that tickliſh Juncture of Time, as advantageous as an Actual and Compleat Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at any other ſeaſon, by keeping up the hearts of the diſpirited people, ſecuring their Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preſerving their Coaſts from the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions and direfull deſolation with which their Land-Frontiers were afflicted.</p>
            <p>However the United Provinces were reduced into ſo lamentable a condition, that the States at length took a Reſolution to ſend two Deputies at the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> one to the <hi>French</hi> King, and another to the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to move thoſe two Princes to come to ſome Accomodation with them. On the

            <p>A few days after the Royal Confederate Fleets appeared before the <hi>Dutch</hi> Coaſt with deſign to make a deſcent near the <hi>Hague, Harlem,</hi> or the <hi>Texel:</hi> But that enterprize was diverted by a kind of Miracle. For on the very day ſingled out for that deſign, as the Enemy was expecting the coming in of the tide, to ſend in their Boats and ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels Laden with Soldiers in order to Land them, it hapned to delay its advance 12 full hours later than Ordinary, contrary to its natural Order, to
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:29562:235"/> the great ſurprize and aſtoniſhment of all that were verſed in Sea affairs, and that ever frequented that Element. That prodigy was lookt upon as one of the moſt ſenſible marks of the Protection of God that begun to declare it ſelf for the States. That Retardation of the Tide was likewiſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a horrible Tempeſt, that forced the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Fleets with terror to quit the <hi>Holland</hi> Coaſts, and to retire homewards with great loſs. For three of their men of War, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Victualling Ships were caſt away or ſwallowed up by the Waves.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> kept with the <hi>Dutch</hi> fleet near the <hi>Holland</hi> Coaſts to have an eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Motions of the Enemies. On the 5th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> news came, that 14 Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> Ships valued at near 14 Millions of Livers were happily arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the mouth of the <hi>Eems</hi> before <hi>Delfzil.</hi> The Enemies had flattered themſelves with the hopes of taking them, and thought it was impoſſible for them to miſs of ſo rich a prize; which obliged them to poſt themſelves near the <hi>Dogger-Sand</hi> to be the readier at hand to ſeize upon them. For they could not imagine, the Government could have time to adviſe them of the Rupture, becauſe they were put to Sea at the time of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the War, and that if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any information of it, that could not have been till it was too late for them to take any precautionary meaſures to ſecure themſelves. But yet by an inſtinct as 'twere of Providence, they ſtole from the vigilance of the Royal Fleets, and the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet ſailed towards the <hi>Eems</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them into the Reſpective Harbours of their own Country, where they arrived on the 22d of the ſame month.</p>
            <p>The States Fleet would have kept at Sea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing longer, but becauſe the ſummer ſeaſon was almoſt paſt, and that Tempeſts would ſoon begin to raign, and that beſides there was no more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:29562:236"/> for that year of any deſcent by the Royal Fleets, or of any other important attempt, they retired home and entred into Port, on the 22d. of <hi>September,</hi> to be diſarmed and laid up.</p>
            <p>From that time forward things begun a little to change face, and <hi>Holland</hi> was ſecured by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ditches and ſluces and overflowing all the Avenues to their Towns; and Proviſion was made likewiſe for the preſervation of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of <hi>Gorkum, Schonhoven,</hi> and <hi>Minden;</hi> For <hi>Naerden,</hi> was then in the Power of the <hi>French.</hi> The march of the Auxiliary Troops ſent by the Emperour and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> to the aſſiſtance of the United Provinces contributed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very much to ſtop the Conqueſts of <hi>France</hi> by the diverſion they gave. For the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King was forced to make great detachments to form an Army under the Command of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Marſhal <hi>Turenne,</hi> to ſend to oppoſe them. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> on another ſide, advanced towards <hi>Charleroy</hi> with deſign to beſiege it, but the great Froſts and Ill Weather that hapned all on a ſudden, broke his meaſures, ſo that after he had taken and plundered <hi>Binch,</hi> that Prince reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. However the Froſts that thus had croſſed the deſigns of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> favoured thoſe of the <hi>French.</hi> For the Duke of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> having formed an Army out of detachments drawn out of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> and other Conquered places, prepared to make an invaſion into the heart of <hi>Holland,</hi> by paſſing his Troops over the Ice. The Count of <hi>Koningſmark,</hi> who had the guard of the paſſes, not finding himſelf ſtrong enough to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, deſerted <hi>Bodgrave,</hi> and retired to <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Luxemburg</hi> ſeeing the Weather was like to change to a Thaw, made his Troops advance with Extraordinary diſpatch, and paſt the <hi>Rhine</hi> with very little reſiſtance by reaſon of the conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſorder among them that guarded the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:29562:236"/> to go further if the Froſt continued to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his deſigns.</p>
            <p>The Retrenchments made near <hi>Nieuwerburg,</hi> were unfortunately deſerted in a moſt unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nick of time; which extreamly favoured the retreat of the <hi>French:</hi> For a Thaw hapning to follow, if that poſt had been preſerved, the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s return had been cut off; who however, was conſtrained to retire with more haſte than ever he made in.</p>
            <p>'Tis not to be Expreſt in what ſtrange alarm and conſternation all <hi>Holland</hi> then was.<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations of the Duke of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi>
               </note> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the States, without loſing Courage for that, neglected not to give the neceſſary orders every where, cauſing the ſluces to be opened, to let in the water round about all the places that were moſt expoſed. The Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> being come near <hi>Gondſche Sluis,</hi> where Count <hi>Koningſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> was poſted with his Troops, found there ſo much reſiſtance, that he was forced to turn back again, carrying deſolation every where along with him, and miſerably Ravaging all the places through which he paſſed. It would be a difficult task to deſcribe all the exceſſive cruelties he committed there; it is enough to ſay, that he carried them to ſuch a height, that no future Ages will ever loſe the Memory of his Barbarities. The Villages of <hi>Swammerdam</hi> and <hi>Bodgrave</hi> were burnt to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, which was the laſt day of the Year, the Troops of <hi>Groningen</hi> returned him his change. For the Froſt that had put by the Seige of <hi>Charleroy</hi> having lockt up the Mariſh waters round about the ſtrong place of <hi>Koeverden,</hi> they took advantage of that opportunity and ſeized that important Fortreſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the principal Events of the Year 1672. and this was the deplorable condition into which the United Provinces were then reduced. But God being pleaſed afterwards to eſpouſe their
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:29562:237"/> Intereſts delivered them from the unſupportable Yoke of Foreign powers, by ſuch ſurprizing means, that they recovered all their places again in leſs time than they had loſt them, as will appear in the ſequel of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the Year 1673. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1673"/> A dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable plot was diſcovered at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to burn the States men of War. The Author of it was one <hi>Fraſer</hi> a <hi>Scotch-man,</hi> who as he confeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was incited to that bold and pernicious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by great promiſes of reward from the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who was ever an irreconcilable Enemy to the United Provinces. That unhappy Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal was therefore broke alive upon the Wheel, and expoſed afterwards near <hi>Voolewyijk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to put themſelves into a condition to make the ſame vigorous reſiſtance againſt the two Fleets of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> which they did the laſt year, the States began with incredible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to forward the preparations making to Arm out a powerfull Fleet. And for that effect, all the Deputies of the Colleges of Admiralty and the Commiſſioners of the Navy, had ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in which it was concluded, that the Fleet ſhould be conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Augmented and Rendred more potent than it ever yet had been.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tromp</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralſhip.</note> In the mean while, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Lieutenant Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> being vacant by the death of Mr. <hi>de Gent</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Cornelius Tromp</hi> when he was diſmiſt from his Employment, His Highneſs, in Quality of Stat-holder, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral General, having a perfect knowledge of <hi>Tromp</hi>'s rare merit, and incomparable valour and Conduct, as well as of the ſingular Zeal and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he had always ſhewn to the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Orange,</hi> repreſented to him of what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it was both to himſelf and the State in that preſſing Juncture, to forget paſt things, and preſt him to accept again of the Office of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:29562:237"/> Admiral of the College of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in order to recontinue his Services to his Country, in a time of ſuch diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>The Prince ſtirr'd ſo warmly in that Affair that he found means to reconcile him to <hi>de Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and thereby to prevent the diſorder the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate hatred of thoſe two Admirals might cauſe in the Fleet. Accordingly they embraced one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the preſence of His Highneſs, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually promiſed to forget all that was paſs'd, and to live thenceforward as brothers.</p>
            <p>The Re-eſtabliſhment of <hi>Tromp</hi> in his former Poſt at Sea cauſed an unexpreſſible joy to all the Seamen in the Fleet, and in General, to all the common people: Who ſeemed confident after the Reconciliation of thoſe two great Men, that the United Provinces would be able to Triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Naval Forces both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> ſo much weight they imagined to be in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that one man to turn the Scale of Victory on their ſide.</p>
            <p>At that time, the States projected an attempt of very great importance, which was to dam up the mouth of the <hi>Thames,</hi> by ſinking in it great many Ships extraordinarily loaden, and ſo to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it unpaſſable. And for that end they had prepared at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> 8 ſhips fitted for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, nay they were already ſent to the <hi>Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> as thinking the ſucceſs of that enterprize de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſolely on the ſpeed uſed in it. In the mean while they laboured and wrought night and day to man out their Fleet that they might have their full Complement early in the ſpring. And if that project had ſucceeded, no doubt but <hi>England</hi> would have felt a long time its effect by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of its Commerce which would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have been totally ruined, and that without any Battle, or Effuſion of Blood.</p>
            <pb n="460" facs="tcp:29562:238"/>
            <p>On the 10th of <hi>May,</hi> the Fleet aſſembled at <hi>Schoonevelde,</hi> and were 80 ſail ſtrong, who the next day, without ſtaying for the <hi>Zealand</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, or the other ſhips that were not yet come to them, ſailed out, and made towards the <hi>Thames.</hi> But a great Fog coming on, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had intelligence of their deſign, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to execute any thing, ſo that they were fain to tack about, and return back again to an Anchor at <hi>Schoonevelde,</hi> the ſhips that were wanting arrived daily to the Fleet, and in the mean while they employed themſelves in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the diviſion of the Squadrons, and the orders they were to obſerve. The whole Fleet was divided into three Spuadrons. Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s was compoſed of 19 men of War in the line of Battle, 4 Frigats, 8 Fire-ſhips, 4 Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Yachts, and 3 Galliots. The General Officers under him, were Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes,</hi> Vice-Admiral <hi>de Liefde,</hi> and Rear-Admiral <hi>Van Nes.</hi> Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi> s Squadron conſiſted of 18 men of War, 5 Frigats, 8 Fire-ſhips, 5 Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Yachts, and 2 Galliots; he had under him, Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſz,</hi> Vice-Admiral <hi>Saar,</hi> and Rear-Admiral <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lug.</hi> Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Squadron conſiſted of 18 men of War, 5 Frigats, 9 Fire-ſhips, 5 Advice-Yachts, and 2 Galliots; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under him, Vice-Admiral <hi>Sweers,</hi> Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Schram,</hi> and Rear-Admiral <hi>de Haan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that diviſion, it was ordered, that Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes</hi> ſhould command in chief Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Squadron during his abſence, and that Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſz</hi> ſhould likewiſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi> till he ſhould come to the Fleet himſelf.</p>

That conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fleet now equipping is one of the moſt powerfull means that can be employed for the preſervation of the State; and there is reaſon to hope, that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will inflame the Courage of thoſe who have the honour to be choſen to have the Conduct of it. The Eyes and Hearts of all the Subjects of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, nay, and of all Chriſtendom are now turned that way, and are attentively obſerving what motions, and what attempts it will make under the Valour and Conduct of thoſe who Govern it. And what infamy will it not be then for them that ſhall be ſo cowardly as to fail in their duty in ſo important and glorious an occaſion? But we expect no ſuch ungratefull News, but rather on the contrary, that by your Prudence and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndaunted Reſolution, as well as by that of thoſe about you, the Glory our Nation has lately gotten by Sea will be maintained with the Protection of God, by the freſh Zeal and Courage which you ſhall exert.

I pray you to aſſure

<pb n="464" facs="tcp:29562:240"/> General Officers of the Fleet with him, to dine on board him. And they made on that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thouſand proteſtations one to the other of a ſincere and tender friendſhip. The other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and all the Captains drunk healths to their Country, giving a thouſand aſſurances of their zeal and inviolable adherence to its ſervice; and they all ſwore, they were ready to ſpend the laſt drop of their blood for its Intereſt. So much good will gave great hopes of an aſſured Victory and an occaſion to make proof of it ſoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, ſince about 4 a Clock in the afternoon, whilſt they were yet at Table, the advanced-guards of the Fleet gave them notice, they had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Enemies Fleet.</p>
            <p>And a little while after, their ſcouts appeared. But becauſe 'twas late, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet tackt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to the North Weſt, and begun to diſpoſe all things ready to come to an Engagement, the next day. The <hi>English</hi> Fleet had caſt Anchor to the Weſt-ward of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and prepared likewiſe for fight, but a Calm coming on, the two Fleets could not come up with one another. The next day there aroſe a ſurly Wind with ſome Rain, which obliged both parties to remain at Anchor in preſence of one another. On the 4th and 5th the Wind roſe higher ſtill, and became more violent. But at length on the 7th. which was the day of the monthly faſt, and the ſame day on which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had attackt the Enemies in <hi>Solbay</hi> the laſt year, the two Fleets engaged.</p>
            <p>Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> held a Council of War as ſoon as it was day, where it was reſolved to weigh their Anchors a-peak to be ready for fight. But no ſooner were the Officers that had been at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, gone off from on board the Admiral, but the two Royal Fleets made a Motion, and having caſt their Squadrons into the form of a Creſcent, made up directly towards the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The Forces of thoſe two Potent Fleets were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:29562:240"/> unequal, according to the <hi>Dutch</hi> reports. For thoſe of the Allies were ſaid to conſiſt of 140 ſail, whereof 90 were Capital men of War, whereas the <hi>Dutch</hi> pretend to have had there but 52 Capital ſhips but ill manned and furniſhed, 12 Frigats, 14 Advice Yachts, and 25 Fire-ſhips, making in all 103 ſail. There were ſeveral ſhips that were not yet come into the Fleet; for of the <hi>Zealand</hi> Squadron there were hardly 4; and of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> and <hi>Groningen,</hi> there were none at all; and of thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam</hi> there were the ſhips of Vice-Admiral <hi>Sweers,</hi> of the Commander <hi>de Meuwen,</hi> of Captain <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel,</hi> and ſeveral others that were not yet come. Nay, they were forced for want of Seamen, to take the men out of 3 <hi>Zealand</hi> Frigats, to man Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi>'s ſhip. In the mean while, the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Fleets, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Weather gage, came nearer and nearer to the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Prince <hi>Robert</hi> who had the Command in chief of the two Royal Fleets, led the Vanguard, which was the Red Squadron. The Count <hi>d' Eſtree</hi> had the Conduct of the main Battle, or of the White Squadron; And Sir <hi>Edward Sprag,</hi> Admiral of the Blue, Commanded the Rear. The <hi>English</hi> being ill ſatisfied at the Conduct of the <hi>French</hi> in the laſt Battle, durſt truſt them no more, but fearing they would deſert them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as they did before, thought fit to place them under their own Squadrons; ſo that Mr. <hi>d' Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedan,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Rear Admiral, was placed under Prince <hi>Robert</hi>'s, Squadron and the Marqueſs <hi>de Grancy</hi> under that of Admiral <hi>Spragg.</hi> As to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, <hi>Tromp</hi> led the Van, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> the main Battle, and <hi>Bankert</hi> the Rear.</p>

<pb n="466" facs="tcp:29562:241"/> follow his example: That for his own part he was ſpurred on by no other intereſt to give proofs of his Zeal to his afflicted Country, but that of the Love and Tenderneſs he had for it: That he had no other end in coming to Sea, but to labour to reſtore the ſhaking State of its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, by delivering it from thoſe Diſaſters and Calamities that were ready to overwhelm it, and which without a ſpeedy and timely aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, threatned it with inevitable ruine. That he had much rather ſacrifice his Life for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to Live to ſuffer its ancient Liberty to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation forced to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the unſupportable Yoke of a Foreign and Tyrannick power. We have, purſued he, a juſt God, and an Equitable Cauſe, upon which having an entire truſt and confidence, I doubt not of a good and happy ſucceſs, if you will but behave your ſelves like brave men.</q> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them at thoſe words, promiſed him to do ſo; and as ſoon as prayers were done, <hi>Tromp</hi> turned to the Seamen of his ſhip, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, <hi>Children, the Enemy is near us, let every one of you now give proofs of his bravery, and ſatisfy the Engagements that brought us hither on board; And if you do it I'll aſſure you, that I will recompenſe you, and that all shall go well.</hi> After that diſcourſe, the Seamen teſtified an unexpreſſible joy, throwing their Caps up into the Air, and crying out! <hi>Long live Tromp?</hi> with promiſe to ſpend to the laſt drop of their blood for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Country.</p>
            <p>About 2 a Clock in the afternoon, the Battle begun. The White Squadron engaged with that of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp.</hi> It is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with what valour and undaunted Courage they fought; and notwithſtanding the inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Forces, thanks, under God, to the Cowardice, or rather perfidiousneſs of the <hi>French</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the advantage after having a long time
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:29562:241"/> wavered, was at laſt forced to declare in favour of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and was by them ſtiled a Victory. Tho' at the ſame time it be certain, that if the <hi>French</hi> had managed the War then only by Land, and left the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to their own ſole but whole ſtrength to attack the <hi>Dutch</hi> by Sea, they would have been ſo far from preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Victory, that they would have inevitably been deſtroyed; ſuch diſadvantage is there ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a confederate Force, tho' ſeemingly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than an Enemies, when the Allies act not in full Concert, Union and Fidelity one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                     <note place="margin">Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi>'s Letter to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note>MY laſt written to your Highneſs was dated the 6th. Inſtant. After noon, the air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to clear up a little, and towards evening we could ſee the Enemies again. During the night the ill weather was quite ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed. On the 7th in the morning it was fair Weather, and the Wind was North-Weſt. That day the Enemies Fleets begun to move. I fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the uſual ſignal to call a Council of War, where it was reſolved to keep our Anchors a-peak, to be ready to be weighed up at the firſt approach of the Enemies. The Officers that had aſſiſted at the Council of War were not yet gone away from on board me, when the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fleets advanced towards us in the form of a Creſcent. The White Squadron that was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the North, was the firſt that enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> and both of them tackt to the North-Eaſt-ward. The Squadrons that were under mine, and Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi>'s Command, could not be ſo ſoon attackt by the Enemies. However to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from ſeparating us, we made likewiſe to the North-Eaſt-ward till about two in the afternoon; and then we thought it time to tack about to the Southward, after we had given the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for it, and ſent notice to Lieutenant Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Tromp,</hi> by an Advice-Yacht of that motion; and then I engaged with the Red Squadron, and <hi>Bankert</hi> with the Blue one. I was more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in breaking in amongſt the Enemies than <hi>Bankert,</hi> for his main Top-maſt, being ſhot down he had much ado to advance, however he got a great way in, we broke quite through the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and we cut ſeveral of their ſhips from the main of their Fleet by getting the Weather-gage
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:29562:242"/> of them. We thought not fit to purſue them, but rather to make a motion towards the North, in Order to veer back towards Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Admiral <hi>Tromp.</hi> We joined him towards evening. When we charged the Enemies they tackt about to the South-ward, and we made the ſame motion, and fought till the night part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us. After the Battle we went and anchored within two miles of <hi>Weſt-Kappel.</hi> As for the particular paſſages of the whole time of the fight, it is impoſſible for us to give an exact relation of them, becauſe we have not yet had time to be informed of them. But however it be, we preſume, that, God be praiſed, the Victory is on the ſide of the States, and of his Highneſs. And in order to make it a Compleat one, we will put our ſelves in readineſs to fight with all the vigour imaginable, hoping that God will bleſs our arms more and more. The fight was furious on both ſides, and on our ſide ſome did better than others, according as the Wind was more or leſs favourable to them, and 'tis like the ſame hapned alſo amongſt the Enemies. There were a great many ſhips endamaged on both ſides. We have loſt ſome Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> Vice Admiral <hi>Schram,</hi> Rear Admiral <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lug,</hi> as likewiſe the Captains, <hi>Van Bergen</hi> and <hi>Bakker;</hi> Captain <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> is dangerouſly wounded. The Fire-ſhips of both Fleets were able to do but little exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and yet a great many of them were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burnt, or ſunk. We have named Rear-Admiral <hi>de Haan</hi> to the Vice-Admiralſhip va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant by the death of <hi>Schram,</hi> under the Flagg of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> and the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Meuwen</hi> to the Rear-Admiral's place, who came to the fleet Yerſterday in the time of the fight. He reported to us, that he had taken a Yacht coming from <hi>London,</hi> laden with refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſome Rich ſuits of Cloaths for the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:29562:243"/> Count <hi>d' Eſtree.</hi> There is likewiſe come to us another frigat from <hi>Frieſland,</hi> carrying 30 Guns, and 150 men. That there might ariſe no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion by removing the flag, I have ordered Rear Admiral <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lug</hi> to put it up in his ſhip till further order. The Captain of a <hi>French</hi> fire-ſhip whom we ſaved, Reports to us, that the <hi>English</hi> fleet conſiſted of 60 men of War, and 30 fire-ſhips, and that the <hi>French</hi> Squadron was compoſed of 30 men of War, the leaſt of which carried 50 Guns, and of 10 or 12 fire-ſhips, and and that reckoning in the Advice-Yachts, the Confederate fleets were compoſed of 140 ſail; That Prince <hi>Robert</hi> Commanded in chief; that the Count <hi>de Eſtree,</hi> had the Conduct of the White Squadron, and Sir <hi>Edward Spragg</hi> that of the Blue; and that the two fleets, <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> were mingled together. The Enemies are at preſent to the North-Weſt and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Weſt-ward, at about two miles diſtance from us, buſy in repairing their damages.</p>

We are perſwaded that the Enemies have loſt <hi>11</hi> or <hi>12</hi> Ships that were burnt or ſunk, and ſeveral Fire-Ships.

But ſince God permitted us not to do that, we are now labouring with ſpeed to repair our damaged Ships. I am returned again on board the <hi>Golden Lion</hi> which wants nothing but her main yard.

            <p>Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> gave likewiſe in this Battle, as he had done in all the precedent ones in which he was preſent, moſt ſignal proofs of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage. The very Number of ſhips he was forced to change, is enough to ſerve for his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logium</hi> in that behalf; for before the fight was over, he had already changed his ſhips three or four times, which were all ſo extreamly ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered that they were quite diſabled. Rear Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>de Haan</hi> behaved himſelf likewiſe very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly, having been forced to ſhift his ſhip three times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>De Ruiter,</hi> and <hi>Tromp</hi> in that rencounter gave one another moſt noble and generous proofs of tenderneſs and affection. By the aſſiſtance <hi>de Ruiter</hi> gave to <hi>Tromp,</hi> he was delivered from the Eminent Peril under which he was ready to ſink; for being engaged in the midſt of two Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of the Enemies, he endured a moſt Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble encounter without any hopes of ever being able to go through it. <hi>Tromp</hi> being ſenſible of his danger begun to deſpair of eſcaping it, unleſs <hi>de Ruiter</hi> would come ſpeedily to his aſſiſtance, and he was already in an extream impatience to ſee him, and comforted up his diſcouraged Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with the hopes of ſeeing themſelves ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by that Great man. And as ſoon as <hi>Tromp</hi> ſaw <hi>de Ruiter</hi> appear, his joy was extream, ſo that he cried out! <hi>Courage, my lads, ſee there's the beſt of our friends that is advancing and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:29562:244"/> to our aſſiſtance, and I likewiſe will never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert him neither ſo long as I live. De Ruiter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi> and his Squadron, broke then through the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Squadrons, and delivered him with as much zeal as fidelity, which promiſed hopefully that the Reconciliation of thoſe two great men, would for the future continue firm and inviolable.</p>
            <p>On the 12 of <hi>June,</hi> the fleet was ſufficiently repaired, and in a condition to attack the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies again; when <hi>de Ruiter</hi> preſently called a Council of War, in which it was Reſolved, that ſince there was no further Reinforcement to be expected from the Country, and that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were to receive one, with the firſt Weſterly Wind, it was better to prevent them, by attacking them firſt, unleſs they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Orders to the contrary from the States; That all things ſhould be got ready for that effect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the 14th. to endeavour by the protection of God, to chaſe them off the Sea. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they Ordered the whole fleet to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three Squadrons. The firſt was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of 17 men of War, 2 frigats, 8 fire-ſhips, and 5 Advice-Yachts, under the Command of Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Van Nes,</hi> Vice-Admiral <hi>de Liefde,</hi> and Rear Admiral <hi>Van Nes;</hi> the ſecond was alſo compoſed of 17 men of War, 2 frigats, 8 fire-ſhips, and 6 Advice Yachts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kert,</hi> Vice Admiral <hi>Evertſz,</hi> and Rear-Admiral <hi>Dik.</hi> Laſtly the third was Commanded by Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> Vice Admiral <hi>Sweers,</hi> and Rear Admiral <hi>de Haan,</hi> and conſiſted likewiſe of 17 men of War, 3 Frigats, 8 Fire-ſhips, and 5 Advice Yachts.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the reſolution was taken to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Enemies, the Deputies of the States, Mr. <hi>Boetſclaar</hi> and Mr. <hi>Reigersbergen</hi> came on board Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> and being informed of the
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:29562:244"/> deſign that was projected, they approved it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Signal was given to the whole Fleet, to ſet ſail, and advance towards the Royal Fleets, whoſe Forces that before the firſt Fight, conſiſted of 140 Sail, were then reduced, as was reported among the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to 118, by the Loſſes they had ſuffered. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet then weighed Anchor between 11 a Clock at Noon; and the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Fleet ſeeing them approach, got themſelves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe under Sail, and made ſhew as if they would have ſtood them, and been glad to engage them; but as ſoon as the <hi>Dutch</hi> begun to come near them, and play their Guns at them, the Enemies tackt away to the North-weſt-ward, and ſtood for the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> with all the Sail they could. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet followed them cloſe, but could not oblige them to make a ſtand, till about 4 in the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>At that Time Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> who commanded the Van-guard, engaged with the <hi>Blue Squadron,</hi> commanded by Sir <hi>Edward Spragg; de Ruiter,</hi> on his ſide attacked the Main Battle, or <hi>Red Squadron,</hi> commanded by Prince <hi>Robert;</hi> and about 5 a Clock the two Chiefs of the Hoſtile Fleets were engaged in a very fierce Fight. A little while after, Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Bankert,</hi> who commanded the Rear, fell likewiſe upon the <hi>White Squadron,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the Count <hi>d' Eſtree.</hi> The Fleets fought a great while, and the Fight was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſtinate; but as the Royal Fleets had ſignified at the very firſt, that they had no mind to engage, they left off Fighting, and dextrouſly made uſe of the Advantage of the Wind, which they had, to retire towards the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts. Lieutenant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Tromp</hi> was the firſt and the laſt in the Fight, and the Bravery with which he attacked Admiral <hi>Spragg,</hi> who likewiſe did Wonders, can never be ſufficiently admired.</p>
            <pb n="474" facs="tcp:29562:245"/>
            <p>Among other remarkable things that happened in that laſt Engagement, Vice-Admiral <hi>Sweers,</hi> that commanded a part of <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Squadron, being in the Ship called the <hi>Elephant,</hi> a much better Sailer than the <hi>Golden Lion,</hi> in which <hi>Tromp</hi> was, going before him, went away ſo ſwiftly that the reſt of the Ships of his Squadron could not follow him, by which means he found himſelf on a ſudden en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with <hi>Spragg,</hi> and the Vice-Admiral of the <hi>English Blue Squadron,</hi> without any Ships near him to back him, but only 3 Frigats commanded by <hi>de Jong, Hartwich,</hi> and <hi>de Noirot;</hi> for the other Captains of his Squadron, inſtead of following him, as they were obliged to do, veered back again towards Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp; Sweers</hi> ſeeing himſelf ſo unexpectedly deſerted, made all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance he could, but after he had born a very fierce Shock, he was ſo terribly ſhattered by the Ships of the <hi>Blue Squadron,</hi> that he was at laſt forced to quit the Line of Battle, and make off further to Sea, to repair his Damages, which Conduct of his was interpreted by <hi>Tromp</hi> to be a piece of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, tho' the Truth was, 'twas pure Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that obliged <hi>Sweers</hi> to act in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> had engaged, as we have ſaid, with Prince <hi>Robert</hi>'s Squadron, and their two Ships having grappled one another fought both very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately. <hi>Bankert</hi> likewiſe ſignalized himſelf, and fought with great Valour againſt the <hi>White Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi> which was very ſeverely handled by him. Prince <hi>Robert</hi> was forced in that Fight to remove out of the <hi>Royal Charles,</hi> that was diſabled, into the <hi>Old Soveraign,</hi> and then making the beſt of his way towards <hi>England,</hi> the two Royal Fleets fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him in Diſorder. In the mean while, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet finding they had the Advantage, paſt that Night in the Place where the Battle was fought, with a Reſolution to advance the next Day and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a third Battle, to the two Royal Fleets, in
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:29562:245"/> caſe they would accept it; but when Day was come, they could ſee neither <hi>English</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> appear, but heard they were retired into the <hi>Thames:</hi> Which was a ſurprizing thing to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to find that two ſuch powerful Fleets as were the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and ſo much ſuperior to them in Force, ſhould ſo ſhamefully fly from them. But the Cauſe of it was imputed to the treacherous Conduct of the <hi>French,</hi> and the Animoſities of Prince <hi>Robert</hi> againſt them on that account, and the Hatred he and moſt of the <hi>English</hi> then in general bore to that leaguing with a Popiſh and Dangerous Power againſt a Proteſtant State, and other Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies then reigning, concerning the pernicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues then carrying on between the already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Duke of <hi>York</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Religion and Conſtitution, which made the Officers and Seamen, very cold in proſecuting the then Quarrel againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> in compariſon of what they had been in the former Wars. However it was, when the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſaw the Enemies were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated home, they retired likewiſe, and went and anchored at <hi>Schooneveld,</hi> from whence Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> writ the following Letter to the States.</p>

            <p>This ſecond Battle coſt the Enemies, according to their own Report, about 3000 Men that were killed or wounded. Two Days after that great Action, the Deputies of the States coming on Board, a Council of War was called, in order to take new Reſolutions about what it were beſt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, that might be uſeful and advantageous to the State: Where the Conduct of Vice-Admiral <hi>Sweers</hi> in the laſt Battle was brought in Queſtion, which cauſed great Diſputes between <hi>Tromp</hi> and <hi>Sweers,</hi> and they were puſht on with ſo great a Tranſport of Heat and Animoſity by <hi>Tromp,</hi> that it was to be feared, they would have been attended with very ill Conſequences.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tromp</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes Vice-Admiral <hi>Sweers</hi> of not doing his Duty.</note>Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> upbraided <hi>Sweers</hi> to his Face, That he had not done his Duty, through a ſhameful Cowardice, which had made him turn his Back before the Enemies. And he alledged, That the ſaid Vice-Admiral going foremoſt, with a part of his Squadron, had not attackt the Enemy as he ought; and further, that he had not maintained the Attack neither, when he was engaged any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he had begun, becauſe he kept ſtill ſo to the Windward, that the Captains that were under him were forced to quit him, and to veer back and
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:29562:246"/> joyn him the ſaid <hi>Tromp,</hi> as all thoſe Captains could faithfully teſtifie.</p>
            <p>To that, Vice-Admiral <hi>Sweers</hi> anſwered in his Juſtification, That the Damages his Ship had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as the great number of Men he had killed and wounded on Board him, ſufficed to clear him from the Injuſtice and cruel Outrage done to his Reputation, ſince by that it might eaſily be ſeen he was hotly engaged with the Enemies at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Fight; but that at laſt his Main-topmoſt being ſhot down, he was forced, much againſt his Will, to retire, in order to repair his Damages; That in ſuch an occaſion it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to change his Ship, becauſe that of Captain <hi>Jong</hi> was as much diſabled as his own, and that beſides the Frigats that ſeconded him were too ſmall to put his Flag up in; And that he made Oath before God, that he was not guilty of the Crime imputed to him, but that he had performed as well as any Man in the Fleet.</p>
            <p>And the Quarrel between theſe two Generals grew ſo hot, that they would have proceeded from Words to Blows, had it not been for the Reſpect they were obliged to have for the Deputies of the States, who were there preſent, and who, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the miſchievous Conſequences that might follow from thoſe Differences, ordered <hi>Cornelius Evertſz, Van Nes,</hi> and <hi>John Dik,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Van Wouw,</hi> the Fiſcal of the Fleet, to go on Board Vice-Admiral <hi>Sweers</hi> Ship, to examine the Damages he had ſuffered, and to report them to the Council of War. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> fortified his Accuſation with 14 Depoſitions which were receiv'd, and which all amounted only to this, <hi>viz. That they had ſeen Vice-Admiral</hi> Sweers <hi>to the Windward, a great way off from the reſt, and knew not the Reaſon of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vice-Admiral <hi>Sweers</hi> replied to all that, in the firſt Place, by a Liſt of the Loſſes and Damages his Ship had ſuffered, authorized by the Atteſtation of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:29562:247"/> the Commiſſioners appointed to examine them, who loudly declared, <hi>That if the Ship had been their own, they muſt have been conſtrained to act in the ſame manner as</hi> Sweers <hi>had done.</hi> In the ſecond place he produced a liſt of his killed and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men, which were to the Number of 32 of the latter, and 11 of the former, which was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by the Chirurgeons of his ſhip. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> taking that affair to heart, ſent word to the Council of War, that he deſired them, to put it off till ſome further time, that he might him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be fully informed of the whole truth of it. <hi>Tromp</hi> and <hi>Sweers</hi> profeſſed themſelves well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with it, and promiſed to conform to his Highneſſes orders, and that was the end of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between thoſe two Generals.</p>
            <p>On the 19th of the month upon advice, that the Royal fleets were retired into the <hi>Thames</hi> Rear Admiral <hi>de Haan</hi> was detacht away with a Squadron of 12 men of War, 2 fire-ſhips, and 4 Advice Yachts, with order to obſerve them. And he reported at his return, that he had heard from a pilot of <hi>Lubeck</hi> that came from <hi>London</hi> on the 16th, that the two Hoſtile fleets were riding near <hi>Sheerneſs</hi> to the Number of about 70 men of War, and that they were to go up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as far as <hi>Tilbury Hope,</hi> to take on board 30000 men of Regular Troops in order to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a deſcent upon the Coaſts of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and that there were already 20 ſhips ready.</p>
            <p>On the 27th. the two fleets of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> put to Sea again, being 150 ſail ſtrong, <hi>viz.</hi> 80 <hi>English</hi> and 28 <hi>French</hi> men of War. The <hi>Dutch</hi> fleet on the other ſide, were but 100 ſail in all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Reinforcements they had lately received; but however, in that dangerous Juncture, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved notwithſtanding the inequality of their Forces to go and meet the Enemies, and give them Battle.

<pb n="479" facs="tcp:29562:247"/> leſs than an Engagement endeavoured to avoid a fight. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> whoſe Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron had the Van, fired ſeveral Guns at them to invite them to an Engagement, and preſented them Battle, but that was not their deſign. The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> obſerving the Enemies behaviour, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it to be a Stratagem they played to make ſhew as if they fled, only to draw the <hi>Dutch</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Coaſts of <hi>Zealand,</hi> that they might have opportunity afterwards to execute their great deſign, which was a deſcent. And in effect, they were not deceived; for the next day towards evening, the Royal Fleets appeared before the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and a day after, before <hi>Scheveling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that motion of theirs, all <hi>Holland</hi> was in an alarm for fear the Enemies ſhould enter into the heart of the Country to waſte and deſtroy it, and therefore in order to oppoſe them, all the Companies of the Burghers of the <hi>Hague,</hi> and of <hi>Delft</hi> and all the peaſants of the villages round about were Commanded to march with all haſte towards the Coaſts. Cannon was likewiſe ſent down thither to furniſh ſufficient batteries of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. About 11 a Clock before noon, 6 or 7 light Frigats approacht ſo near the Coaſts by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Tide, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> on ſhore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to play their Cannon at them, which the <hi>English</hi> anſwered with the like, but without doing much miſchief. After that the Enemies made off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the main Sea, and ſhew'd themſelves the ſame day in the afternoon, near <hi>Zandvoort</hi> and <hi>de Wikopzee,</hi> about three miles from the ſhore, and ſending up 2 Frigats near to this laſt place, they bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it for ſome time with their Guns. The next day they appeared likewiſe before <hi>Egmond</hi> and <hi>Petten,</hi> and laſtly before <hi>Helder,</hi> and the <hi>Texel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hearing at the Army which was encampt at <hi>Ramſdonk</hi> that the Enemies Fleets hovered about the Coaſts of <hi>Holland,</hi> came with
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:29562:248"/> all haſt to the <hi>Hague</hi> where he arrived on the 4th. of the month very early in the morning. He had ordered his Regiment of Guards and ſome Horſe, to follow him in order to relieve the Burg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers that had guarded the Coaſts of <hi>Scheveling</hi> under the Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Waldee,</hi> likewiſe came to the <hi>Brill</hi> at the ſame time, to give the neceſſary orders there; and General <hi>Wirtz</hi> was ſent to <hi>Walcheren</hi> to look after the preſervation of that poſt.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> after he had been at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conferences held concerning the affairs of the Land Army, went down to the Fleet to give likewiſe his orders there; and he no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on board Admiral <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> but they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him with 13 Guns in acknowledgment of the honour of his preſence, after which he aſſiſted at the Council of War, where it was reſolved Battle ſhould be given the Enemies as ſoon as it was poſſible, in hopes thereby to force them at leaſt to quit the Coaſts and Harbours of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Provinces. Thoſe Reſolutions being taken his Highneſs repreſented to every one their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and what great neceſſity there was in ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an occaſion, to fight courageouſly for the Honour and Intereſt of their Country: That done, he left the Fleet, with the acclamations of the Seamen who cried out <hi>Long live the Prince,</hi> and returned back towards the <hi>Hague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet without any further delay, weighed Anchor the very next day, and ſteered away directly towards the <hi>Texel,</hi> where the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fleets were; but by reaſon of contrary winds they could not get up with the Enemies Fleet till the 20th.<note place="margin">A third fi ht.</note> The next day in the morning, the fight begun, which proved one of the moſt furious and bloody ones that ever was recorded in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and that ever was fought upon the Ocean. The <hi>Dutch</hi> having got the Weather gage in the night fell upon the Enemies about the break of
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:29562:248"/> day. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> had the van-guard, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> Commanded the main Battle, and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kert,</hi> the Rear. About half an hour after 7, the Royal Fleets made a motion, to attack the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers. De Ruiter</hi> upon that preſently gave a ſignal, and made his Squadrons make another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preſerve the advantage of the Weather-gage, and to prevent the Enemies attack by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking them firſt. By that motion, <hi>Bankert</hi>'s Squadron that had the Rear before came to have the Van; <hi>de Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About half an hour after 8, <hi>Bankert</hi> fell upon the Count <hi>d' Eſtree</hi>'s Squadron, which had the Van of the Royal Fleets, <hi>de Ruiter</hi> attack'd Prince <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s Squadron, and <hi>Tromp</hi> the Blue one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir <hi>Edward Spragg.</hi> Then the fight was general,<note place="margin">The French deſert the Engliſh.</note> and the two contending Fleets were throughly engaged. However, the <hi>French,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only Rear Admiral <hi>Martel,</hi> who fought with all the bravery imaginable, ſhew'd by their Conduct, that their deſign was to husband and ſpare their forces, and according to the opinion of moſt knowing men, it was preſumed, the Count <hi>d' Eſtree,</hi> tho' he made a ſhew of fighting brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a time, had ſecret orders from his Maſter to act in that manner, ſo that about 11 a Clock they very fairly made a tack about to the Eaſt-ward, and ſtood off to the Wind-ward, where they remained malicious ſpectators of the reſt of the fight.</p>
            <p>Admiral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> being engaged with Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> thoſe two Admiral's and their Squadrons fought moſt deſperately. Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Bankert</hi> ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> were gone off, thought not fit to purſue them any longer, for fear of being drawn away too far off from the main of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, but veered back towards the main Battle, and went to the aſſiſtance of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>de Ruiter.</hi> Prince <hi>Robert</hi> ſeeing the main
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:29562:249"/> force of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> falling upon him, and that the <hi>French</hi> had left him in the Lurch, and would not come in to his aſſiſtance to enable him to diſpute the victory, and being almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, he and his, by the furious firing of two entire <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadrons, thought it time to provide for his and their ſafety, by a prudent retreat, and ſo ſteered away to the Weſt-ward with all the ſail he could make, and quitted the fight, leaving the advantage and claim of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and was purſued by <hi>de Ruiter, Van Nes</hi> and <hi>Bankert,</hi> till two a Clock in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blue Squadron, and that of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> having made a tack to the North in fighting, were already gotten to ſuch a diſtance from the main of their Fleets, that they were out of ſight. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>de Ruiter</hi> fearing <hi>Tromp</hi> might be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thought fit to go and ſeek him out, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to aſſiſt him. And accordingly he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with his own and <hi>Bankert</hi>'s Squadron that way.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Robert</hi> obſerving the motion made by <hi>de Ruiter,</hi> begun to be in as much fear for <hi>Spragg</hi> as <hi>de Ruiter</hi> was in for <hi>Tromp;</hi> And therefore without any further heſitation, he ordered his Squadron to make the ſame motion as his Enemy that he might follow him; the Count <hi>de Eſtree</hi> with his Squadron followed him; but yet neither of them thought good to come near the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> any more, for fear of being obliged to come to a freſh engagement with them, and therefore they prudently kept at a diſtance out of the reach of Cannon-ſhot.<note place="margin">The terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween <hi>Tromp</hi> and <hi>Spragg.</hi>

            <pb n="483" facs="tcp:29562:249"/>
            <p>Vice-Admiral <hi>Sweers</hi> who Commanded a part of <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Squadron, was engaged with the foremoſt Ships of the Blue Squadron, Commanded by Vice Admiral <hi>Kempthorn</hi> and Rear Admiral the Earl of <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory. Sweers</hi> attackt <hi>Kempthorn</hi> ſo vigorouſly that he was forced at laſt to give way, which put to the rout moſt of the Ships of the Blue Squadron who were purſued by the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> But the two chiefs of the contending Squadrons continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fighting for 7 hours together with ſo much obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, that the Cannon and ſmall ſhot played per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually without any intermiſſion from both the two Admirals upon one another.</p>
            <p>There hapned a thing extreamly ſurprizing, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible to <hi>Tromp</hi> in that Battle, that ſhews the great happineſs that attended him in all the fights he was preſent in; which is that the Combat had already laſted 6 hours before he had ſo much as one man killed or wounded,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>Spragg</hi> being thus diſabled, 15 or 16 ſhips of his Squadron, advanced and fell upon the <hi>Golden Lion</hi> in which <hi>Tromp</hi> was, to revenge their friend's Quarrel, and ſetting ſome fire-ſhips at her, had like to have burnt her, but <hi>Tromp</hi> repulſed them ſo dextrouſly that they could do him no harm.

            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Blue Squadron and that of <hi>Tromp</hi> were engaged in a bloody and obſtinate fight, and if Prince <hi>Robert</hi> had not come in ſpeedily to the aſſiſtance of the Blue Squadron, it had been totally defeated, which the Prince well foreſeeing advanced with all imaginable haſte, and joyned the the Blue Squadron about four a Clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, and <hi>de Ruiter</hi> and <hi>Bankert</hi>'s Squadron had done the ſame thing with <hi>Tromp</hi>'s.

Here follow the Letters written concerning that Action, by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admirals, to the States.</p>

At Night they ſteered to the Eaſt-ſouth-eaſtward, as we thought fit to do to the Weſt-north-weſtward; ſo that the Wind turning to the Eaſt, we found our ſelves Yeſterday-Morning in ſight of the Coaſts of <hi>Holland,</hi> having the Weather-gage. I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave the Signal for our Fleet to get into Order of Battle, with a Reſolution to attack the Enemy. The Royal Fleets ſeeing us prepare for Fight, did the like on their ſide; ſo that about half an Hour after 7, the two Fleets engaged. I attackt Prince <hi>Robert, Bankert</hi> attackt the Count <hi>d' Eſtree,</hi> and <hi>Tromp</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Spragg.</hi> We broke reciprocally one through the other, having ſometimes the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-gage, and ſometimes loſing it. The Allies Fleet made at firſt a great effort with 28 Fireſhips, which they had, whereof 8 or 10 were deſtroyed in part by our Boats, who forced them to ſet Fire to them themſelves, and then to quit them; We
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:29562:251"/> likewiſe loſt 4 or 5 of ours. A Captain of an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Fireſhip that was taken Priſoner, reported to us, That the Enemies 5 or 6 Days ago took one of our Ships, homewards bound from the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> which came away before the reſt. The Fight laſted till the beginning of the Night, and ended not but with the Retreat of the Royal Fleets, who ſteered away towards the <hi>English</hi> Coaſt in a very ſhattered Condition. Admiral <hi>Spragg</hi>'s Ship was towed away by ſome Frigats, having loſt all her Maſts. One of their biggeſt Men of War is ſunk, and we have loſt none at all. As for the Officers of our Fleet, we have loſt the two Vice-Admirals, <hi>de Liefde</hi> and <hi>Sweers,</hi> and the Captains, <hi>Van Guelder,</hi> my Son-in-Law, and <hi>Sweerius,</hi> beſides ſeveral others wounded.

                  <p>THO' the Royal Fleets of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> had on the 20th inſtant the Weather-gage, yet the Wind next Morning chopping about to the Eaſt-ſouth-eaſt, we found our ſelves to the Wind-ward, and they to the Lee-ward. Our Fleet was about a Mile from the Country of <hi>Petren.</hi> We tackt about to the North, and the Enemies to the South; about 8 a Clock we likewiſe made the ſame Motion to follow them.

Being come up directly to Admiral <hi>Spragg,</hi> we cannonaded him ſo terribly, that his Main and Mizzen Maſts were both ſhot down, and then we were diſpoſing our ſelves either to Board him or Burn him; but the Ships of his Squadron that backt him, running in to his Aid, made ſo great a Reſiſtance that our Ship was reduced into a pitiful Condition, and was ſo diſabled that I was forced to quit her, to remove into the <hi>Comet,</hi> where I put up my Flag about 2 a Clock in the Afternoon. In the mean while the Enemies having made themſelves Maſters of the Weather-gage, our Men were ſo far from letting them keep any Advantage from thence, that they attackt them with ſo much the more Bravery and Courage, and reduced them into ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that their Squadron was almoſt ruined by it.

            <p>After that happy Advantage, which in that Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was more worth than a much greater Victory, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet continued at Sea till the 22d of <hi>September,</hi> and then becauſe there was no Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any thing conſiderable likely to paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Royal Fleets, during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of that Year the States ſent them Orders to retire home.

            <p>Theſe three ſucceſſive Advantages the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet had gotten over the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> quite ruined all the Conqueſts the <hi>French</hi> King had made by Land, with as much Rapidity as Succeſs; for thereby the Coaſts and Havens of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> being freed from the Oppreſſion of two powerful Fleets, that kept them as it were beſieged, the <hi>Dutch</hi> had thereby time to take Breath, and to draw from thence the Troops that were poſted there, and to employ them elſewhere. For the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſeeing Fortune begun to declare her ſelf for his Arms, marched the States Army, that was reinforced by ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, towards <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erden,</hi> in order to beſiege it; and after the Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Place, he joyned the Emperors Army under the Command of Count <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> and formed the Siege of <hi>Bonne,</hi> that was taken on the 14th of <hi>November.</hi> Which happy Succeſſes, and the Arrival of the Imperialiſt, abſolutely broke the Meaſures of <hi>France</hi> and its Allies, and forced them all at a ſpurt to quit the Conqueſts they had made with ſo much Rapidity, by diſabling them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, without leaving themſelves without Troops ſufficient to oppoſe to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and Imperialiſts in the Field, which it was much more dangerous for them, to let their Enemies be Maſters of, than it was prejudicial to quit their late Conqueſts, and the Pride they took in having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them.</p>
            <p>Therefore on the 7th of <hi>October</hi> they quitted <hi>Woorden,</hi> on the 14th of <hi>November Bommel,</hi> and on the 23d of the ſame Month <hi>

As ſoon as the Troops were landed, they drew up in order of Battle, and advanced towards the Caſtle, and when they came within Musket-ſhot of it, becauſe it was now Evening, they made a Halt.

On the other ſide, a part of the Fleet approaching as near as could be to the Caſtle, fired furiouſly at it, which the <hi>French</hi> did their beſt to anſwer in the like kind. On the 28th the <hi>Dutch</hi> went and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campt at <hi>Soiſon,</hi> where they ſeized on all the Cattle of the Country, and ſent them to the Fleet: The ſame Day the Admirals <hi>Bankert</hi> and <hi>Van Nes</hi> were commanded to move to the Weſtward of the Caſtle, where it was loweſt. On the 29th a Bark belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Caſtle came out to the Fleet with a White Flag, and brought a Letter from <hi>de Lorgerie,</hi> to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Generals, to let them know that he wanted Refreſhments, and that if they would give him leave for two or three Fiſhing Veſſels they ſhould catch Fiſh for him and them too; but Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Tromp</hi> would by no means grant his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
               <p>On the 30th <hi>Tromp</hi> ſent another Trumpeter to the Caſtle, To deſire the Releaſe of ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Priſoners, in conſideration that the Count <hi>de Horn</hi> had already releaſed a great Number of theirs, both Men, Women and Children. Upon which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the Governour ſent back 17 Soldiers and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and one Drummer, who venturing to ſtraggle too far from the Army were taken by the <hi>French;</hi> and becauſe in ſo doing they had tranſgreſſed their Orders, two of them at their Return were hanged for an Example. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> after having ſtaid two Days upon the Iſland, reſolved at length to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbark again, without attempting any thing more upon the Caſtle, becauſe they thought it would coſt too much Time formally to beſiege it. They carried off with them only three Pieces of Cannon from the Iſland to the Fleet.</p>
               <p>On the 2d of <hi>July</hi> they unmoored, and on the 3d came to an Anchor in the Bay of <hi>Bourgneuf,</hi> right againſt <hi>Narmourtiers,</hi> and employed the reſt of the Day in making the neceſſary Preparations
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:29562:256"/> in order to a Deſcent the next Morning. In the mean while, Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> took Boat and went and viewed where it might be moſt proper to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it. The Enemies had made ſeveral Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Shore, and had placed there their Muſqueteers. On the 4th the Signal was given for Landing, and thereupon all the Troops getting into Boats for that purpoſe, approached the Shore, to which they were forced to climb up over Rocks, or wade through the Water as high as their middles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> at the firſt Approach of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> fired ſomething briskly upon them, but as ſoon as they ſaw them advance, and march towards them with an undaunted Reſolution, they deſerted their Retrenchments, and retired a great way up into the Country. They likewiſe quitted the Caſtle of the Iſland, ſo that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were all landed about 7 in the Evening, and put up the Prince's Colours upon the Caſtle, and upon the Mills. They found 17 Pieces of Cannon planted along the Shore, which were ſent to the Fleet, and 12 Ships that had been forced to run aground. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> in land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had but 135 M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Upon thoſe Advices, the Count <hi>de Horn</hi> haſtned the March of his Troops, with a Reſolution to oppoſe their Paſſage, leaving Captain <hi>Brakel</hi> with 3 Companies of Seamen and 60 Muſqueteers in the Caſtle, and Captain <hi>Hardenbrock,</hi> with Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Company of Seamen in the Abbey, to guard thoſe Poſts. The Army being arrived towards Evening to the Place by which the <hi>French</hi> were to paſs, found they were all retired back into the firm Land, where there appeared a Body of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſe and Foot. But the Army wanting Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they were obliged to remove, and encamp an

Mr. <hi>de Zomerſdyk</hi> at the Sight of them, poſting himſelf with 60 Musketeers behind a Riſing Ground, made a Shew with his Men as if they had been <hi>French,</hi> the better to amuſe and decoy them; whilſt, on the other ſide, the <hi>Dutch</hi> fell upon them ſo ſuddenly, that they were forced to yield.</p>
               <p>That Iſland contains about 1000 Houſes, and is not above 250 Paces diſtant from the main Land, ſo that the <hi>French</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> on the other could mutually cannonade one another. For when the Tide is low, the ſpace between <hi>Bouin</hi> and <hi>Beauvoir,</hi> which is in the main Land of <hi>Poitou,</hi> is ſo very dry, that as many Men as pleaſe may paſs in a Rank from either of the Places to the other, which may be done two Hours after the going out of the Tide.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French,</hi> to intimidate the <hi>Dutch,</hi> gave out a Report, That their King had ſent Orders to all the Horſe and Foot that were on the other Side, to paſs over to oppoſe their Depredations, and force them to quit that Poſt; but for all their Bravado's their Countenance well ſhewed, they were more apprehenſive of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> than the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> were of all their falſe Alarms, ſince they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all the Straw and Boiling Veſſels that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to their Salt-pits, to <hi>Bouin</hi> and <hi>Beauvoir,</hi> for Security. In the mean while Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> commanded all his Ships to return again to their Flag; on the 7th he approached the Shore with his whole Fleet, and recommended to his General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſtrictly to forbid their Seamen, under Pain of Death not to amuſe themſelves with plundring aſhore either Cattle, or any thing elſe.</p>

               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> likewiſe at the ſame time Declared War againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and thereupon immediately ſent his Fleet after its Junction with the Ships of the <hi>Hollanders Quota,</hi> into the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> to cruize upon the Coaſts of <hi>Pomerania;</hi> and drew up his Land-Army at <hi>Gadebuſch,</hi> where the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> met him; and thoſe two Princes having held a Council of War toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to Conſult upon what enterprizes they might moſt advantageouſly employ their Troops, after that, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> advanced to <hi>Wiſmar,</hi> where he left 6 Regiments to block up that place, and then marcht away with the main of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my towards <hi>Damgarten</hi> in <hi>Pomerania;</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the Troops of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> entred the Country of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and General <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> with a body of 3000 <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> ſeized the Iſle of <hi>Wollyn,; Damgarten</hi> was alſo reduced under the obedience of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and a little while after <hi>Wiſmar</hi> alſo ſurrendred to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who beſieged it in perſon.</p>

'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſeized upon <hi>Swingerſchans</hi> in the month of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and defeated the <hi>Munſterian</hi> Troops in the Dutchy of <hi>Bremen,</hi> but thoſe happy beginnings were followed by perpetual loſſes one after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo as they were the firſt that begun the War on that ſide, they were likewiſe the firſt that felt the diſaſtrous effects of it, and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented they had ſo unadviſedly engaged in it upon the deluſive ſuggeſtions of a falſe and ſelf-ended Allie.</p>
               <p>Fortune which had followed the Arms of the Allies in all the attempts they had hitherto made by Land upon the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Dominions, Declared herſelf likewiſe in their favour at Sea. For at the very beginning of the year, the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the United Provinces had reſolved joyntly with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to ſend early in the Spring, a Fleet of 40 ſail of men of War into the <hi>Sound, viz.</hi> 25 <hi>Daniſh,</hi> and 15 <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, of which <hi>Tromp</hi> was to be the Commander in chief: And accordingly they ordered all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable diligence to be uſed in fitting out that Fleet; which being effected, <hi>Tromp</hi> ſailed out of the <hi>Texel</hi> on the 11th. of <hi>May,</hi> with the Ships deſigned for the North with which join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral Merchant Ships, and on the 12th. he arrived in the Road of <hi>Copenhagen</hi> where the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi>

               <p>In the mean while, Admiral <hi>Niels Juel</hi> being entred the month before into the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea with a Squadron of 12 men of War, and a Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 8 more, ſeized upon the Iſle of <hi>Gothland.</hi> After which expedition, he received a further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of 6 men of War <hi>Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> ſo that he had then a Fleet of 26 Capital men of War with which he cruized in the <hi>Baltick.</hi> At the beginning of <hi>June</hi> he deſcried the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet conſiſting of 44 men of War beſides Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſmall craft; and on the 4th of the ſame month at 6 in the evening the two Fleets en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged between <hi>Schoonen,</hi> and <hi>Bornholm;</hi> and tho' the <hi>Swedes</hi> were ſuperiour to the <hi>Danes</hi> in Number of Ships and men, yet they never durſt attempt to board any of them, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves only with firing at them at a reſpectfull diſtance.

But when the <hi>Swedes</hi> found there was little appearance of getting the better of the <hi>Danes,</hi> they begun to recoil, which was the cauſe, that neither of the two Fleets were much dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

<pb n="509" facs="tcp:29562:262"/> the Enemies Fleet being about 50 ſail ſtrong, great and ſmall, according to the report of our advanced guards. And becauſe in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon the wind grew higher, and the Enemies had the advantage of it, they made uſe of it to ſlide away from us, ſo that we had much ado to follow them. The night following, we purſued them with full ſail, but then changing their Courſe they ſtole out of our ſight by favour of the darkneſs; which obliged us to ſend a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of 7 light Frigats to go and hunt them out, and get ſome new diſcoveries of them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout noon, we deſcried them to the South-Eaſt-ward of our Fleet, upon which we preſently gave the ſignal to all the Fleet to make all the ſail they could to get up with them, and we followed them till the dusk of night. On the 11th of <hi>June</hi> before noon, we diſcovered them again to the South-ward of <hi>Oeland,</hi> and at 11 a Clock we got up ſo nigh to them, that they were forced to caſt themſelves into a line of Battle. About noon the wind was Weſt-North-Weſt, and we had the Weather-gage; and then the two Fleets engaged: And no ſooner was the fight begun, but the Ship called the <hi>Three Crowns</hi> carrying 134 Guns, and Commanded by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Admiral, was overſet, and blown up into the air in a little time after, by I know not what accident, ſince I had given her but very few broadſides. At that, all the whole Enemies Fleet made as if they would fly. I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave the ſignal for attacking them on all ſides, and falling upon them with our whole Fleet, which motion made them ſtop ſhort, we then tackt to the South-ward, and I drew near them, and flankt the Enemies Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's Ship that was the chief of a Squadron, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying 96 Guns. I vigorouſly charged both that and the other Ships that ſeconded her. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had fired at one another reciprocally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:29562:263"/> an hour and an half, the <hi>Swedish</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals main-maſt was at laſt ſhot down, and I forced him to ſtrike his Flag, and to beg Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I granted him becauſe of his vigorous reſiſtance, and the bravery he had ſhewed, and I ſent my boat to fetch him off, but it was too late; For one of our Fire-Ships having grapled his Ship, not conſidering he had ſtruck his Flag, and that I had given no ſignal at all for any to board her, ſhe was burnt to Aſhes; ſo that that fine Ship periſht with all her men, which were to the Number of 650 Seamen, excepting only 50 which were ſaved by a Boat, amongſt whom was a Prieſt. That hapned about 6 in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon. The Enemies Fleet, after the fatal loſs of two Admirals, ſeeing that Fortune fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured us, and that the wavering Victory was ready to declare it ſelf for the <hi>Danish</hi> Fleet, thought it time to make away into the Main Sea, ſo that all the Ships which compoſed it, confuſedly betook themſelves to flight, and ſtole away by the help of their ſails from the purſuit of the Victours. They left behind them the <hi>Neptune,</hi> of 44 Guns, and 198 men, which was taken by Captain <hi>Van Zyl.</hi> There was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe another taken as conſiderable as that. The Enemies did all they poſſibly could two ſeveral times to burn me, but their Fire-Ships were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Repulſed. Beſides, 'tis a ſurprizing thing, and that proves, that Juſtice and the bleſſing of God follows the arms of all the Allies, that they loſt not one Ship in ſo memorable an Action, and are hardly at all endamaged: The greateſt da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages my Ship has ſuffered, conſiſts in Sails and Rigging, and ſome ſhot received between wind and water. My firſt Captain, <hi>Ad an Akker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoot</hi> died in the bed of honour, and my ſecond Captain, <hi>Teuniſz Van Anten</hi> had his right arm ſhot off whilſt he was ſignalizing himſelf. The Captain that Commanded the Land Troops

The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Yeſterday in the morning we ſaw one of their Ships ſtranded, and towards evening another of their biggeſt were ſtaved againſt the Rocks of <hi>Weſterwyk.</hi> We took from them a Frigat of 16, and a Yacht of 6 Guns. But I know not what paſſed in the Squadron of Admiral <hi>Niels Juel,</hi> of whom we have heard nothing ſince the Fight. Since the ſhattered remainder of the Enemies Fleet is retired into the firſt Ports they could find, to avoid our purſuit, and that not any of their Ships appear any longer at Sea, we have reſolved to go to <hi>Stede,</hi> or <hi>Bogt Van Kuik,</hi> to confer with his <hi>Danish</hi> Majeſty, and to take the orders that ſhall be judged agreeable to the preſent State of affairs.

               <p>The loſſes the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſuffered in that Battle amounted to 10 capital men of War, amongſt which were 2 Admirals, 1 Frigat and 1 Yacht, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great Number of men killed and wounded. It will be impertinent to relate here what cauſed the deſtruction of the firſt Admiral's Ship that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for one of the fineſt that ever appeared yet in the Northern Seas. It carried 134 Braſs Guns, and 1100 men. At the approach of the Allies Fleet, Admiral <hi>Kruits</hi> who was in her, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Guns to be placed on one ſide in their Carriages that he might be ready to fire a whole broadſide; after which the gunners were ordered to paſs to the other ſide, which they did; but they having forgot to make the Guns faſt, the Ship turned on her other ſide, which made
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:29562:264"/> all the Guns flie out of their Port-holes, and fall on the other ſide, and ſo overſet the Ship. And that diſaſter was ſoon followed with a greater, which was that the lighted matches fell into the Powder-Room, which ſome moments after blew up the Ship.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swedish</hi> Fleet having been chaſed almoſt as far as <hi>Stockholm</hi> by the <hi>Danes,</hi> Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> ſailed to the <hi>Sound</hi> with his Squadron, and came to an Anchour at <hi>Kongerbotcht.</hi> Great rejoycings were made at <hi>Copenhagen</hi> for the Victory lately obtained over the <hi>Swedes;</hi> after which the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was reſolved to puſh his Conqueſts ſtill further. And for that effect ſent Orders to Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> to come with the Confederate Fleet to <hi>Vistad,</hi> to endeavour, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to make a deſcent on that ſide, in <hi>Schonen,</hi> whilſt he on the other, ſhould enter it with his Land-Army. Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> punctually executed thoſe orders, by coming with all ſpeed before that Harbour; where being arrived, he ſent a Trumpeter in a Boat, to ſummon the Governour to ſurrender the place. But Mr. <hi>Veerſen</hi> who Commanded there, made anſwer to <hi>Tromp,</hi> that the guard of that place was as much entruſted to him, as the Conduct of the Fleet was to <hi>Tromp,</hi> and that conſequently he was reſolved to defend it like a brave Soldier againſt all that ſhould attack it.</p>
               <p>After that anſwer, <hi>Tromp</hi> ſent a detachment of 4 Frigats, and 3 Galliots, to advance near the Town, and to Cannonade it; but by reaſon of a Calm coming on, it was impoſſible for him to execute any thing that day, but he was forced to ſtay till the next day, when the Frigats approaching within Musket ſhot of the Ramparts begun to play, at them with their Guns. In the afternoon <hi>Tromp</hi> reinforced them with 4 frigats more, and they fired ſo furiouſly with all their Guns at the Ramparts, that no body durſt appear any more upon them. After which a body of 3000 Seamen and Soldiers were Commanded to make a deſcent
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:29562:264"/> on both ſides of the Town. The Burghers did all they could, to oppoſe them with a body of 700 Horſe, and 150 Foot. But as ſoon as the <hi>Danes</hi> had Landed under ſhelter of the Great Guns that ſo hotly fired againſt all the ſhore, the <hi>Swedes</hi> were forced to retire with the loſs of 151 men killed or wounded, and the <hi>Danes</hi> advanced near the Town.</p>
               <p>About 6 at night, the Admiral ordered the Troops to be in readineſs to attack the Town on both ſides as ſoon as ever he ſhould give the ſignal for it, but firſt he thought fit to Summon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour once more to ſurrender it; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants begun to ſhew themſelves, and reported, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had quitted it, but that they had min'd it before their Retreat. The <hi>Danes</hi> thereupon preſently ſeized it, cleared it of the Mines, and refortified it with a Reſolution to maintain it, and defend it ſtoutly in caſe the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſhould return with an Army to attack them, and for that end, they drew out of the Fleet ſuch a proportion of Guns and Ammunition as was thought neceſſary, and carried into the Town.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> having embarkt his Army conſiſting of 18000 Men, Horſe and Foot, unmoor'd the 8th of <hi>July</hi> with a Fleet of 500 Ships, and came to an Anchor the next day before <hi>Raa</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coaſt of <hi>Schonen</hi> between <hi>Helſingburg</hi> and <hi>Landskroon,</hi> accompanied by the Prince his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Generals of his Army.

But the Garriſon retiring into the Caſtle defended themſelves there for a while very ſtoutly; however, at length ſeeing there was but ſmall hopes of any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:29562:265"/> they yielded at diſcretion on the 14th of the month.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> obſerving that the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> King, tho' he was in Perſon at the head of his Army, was not in a condition to oppoſe his Ravages, and to oblige <hi>Tromp</hi> to quit <hi>Viſtad,</hi> but that he was ſo far from that, as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Christianſtadt,</hi> reſolved to purſue his Conqueſts ſtill further, and ſo taking advantage of the opportunity fortune preſented him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campt on the 15th with his Army from <hi>Helſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and march'd directly to <hi>Landskroon,</hi> which he cauſed to be attackt with ſword in hand, and reduced it. But the <hi>Danes</hi> with all the diligence they could uſe, were not able to prevent the <hi>Swedes</hi> from retiring into the Caſtle which was extreamly ſtrong both by Situation and the Art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full works about it. They defended themſelves there like brave Soldiers, but were at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to yield. On the next day being the 18th. his <hi>Danish</hi> Majeſty marcht his Army to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianſtadt</hi> and ſummoned it to ſurrender, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on refuſal, took it by force of Arms. The <hi>Danish</hi> Arms made likewiſe a great progreſs in <hi>Norway</hi> and Victory followed them every where: For the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of <hi>Wennersburg</hi> was taken there by the Sieur <hi>de Guldenlieu,</hi> and a part of the Country of <hi>Daals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and of <hi>Weſtergothland</hi> was likewiſe put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Contribution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>On another ſide, the Arms of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> were no leſs Triumphant than thoſe of the <hi>Danes.</hi> For he entred <hi>Pomerania</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Danish</hi> Admiral <hi>Wibe,</hi> who was ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the place of <hi>Marcus Rotſteyn,</hi> who was accuſed not to have done his duty before <hi>Gotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> undertook at the ſame time to burn the <hi>Swedish</hi> men of War that were at Anchor before <hi>Elsburg;</hi> but he ſucceeded not; however the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> Admiral fled, to avoid the danger, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſhip whoſe head was ſhot off, ſunk. The Vice Admirals ſhip had the ſame misfortune as the ther, the Ship called <hi>Kalmerſtet</hi> lay drie for 3 days together, and a ſmall Veſſel, and a <hi>Swedish</hi> Fire-ſhip periſht likewiſe by the flames. The <hi>Swedes</hi> upon that attempt retired up nearer to <hi>Elsburg</hi> to Repare all their damages.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Swedeland</hi> ſeeing there was no other means to put a ſtop to the conqueſt of the <hi>Danes,</hi> but by venturing a Battle, after he had received a Reinforcement of 5000 <hi>Finlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and ſome of the Country Militia, took a Reſolution to march in perſon towards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:29562:266"/> with an Army of 18000 men. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly marched to <hi>Helſingburg</hi> which he took without much reſiſtance. The <hi>Danes</hi> were reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Fort, and the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf with the hopes of forcing them to ſurrender, but they made ſo vigorous a reſiſtance that he was forced to retire with loſs. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> hearing the King of <hi>Swedeland</hi> was upon his march, went and poſted himſelf between <hi>Landskroon</hi> and <hi>Helſingburg,</hi> for fear otherwiſe if he ſhould not cut of his paſſage, he ſhould enter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Country. The two Armies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by that means came and remained in ſight of each other, each of them having their King at their head, and being ſeparated from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only by a River. And a great froſt coming on, the River that parted them was frozen, which gave occaſion to a bloody battle that was fought the 14th of <hi>December,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſeized upon <hi>Karelſhaven,</hi> and marcht to <hi>Chriſtianſtadt.</hi> The King thereupon without any heſitation, reſolved to go in perſon into <hi>Schonen.</hi> His arrival broke the deſigns of the <hi>Swedes</hi> who went and poſted themſelves near <hi>Landskroon</hi> without daring to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a Battle which the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them.

               <p>After two hours fight the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Admiral, who was in a ſhip carrying 60 Guns and 300 men, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtrike his Flag, and to yield at diſcretion. And the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Admirals ſecond took the Ship called the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> carrying 50 Guns, and 260 men. The <hi>Danish</hi> Vice Admiral took the ſhip called <hi>Kalmar Kaſteel</hi> carrying 74 Guns, and 400 men. Captain <hi>Dreyer</hi> took the <hi>Wrangle Paleis</hi> of 44 Guns, and 300 men, and Captain <hi>de Wit</hi> took the <hi>Meerman</hi> of 46 Guns and 300 men.

               <p>Thoſe happy Progreſſes animated the <hi>Daniſh</hi> K. to attempt the Conqueſt of ſome important Place; for which end he march'd his Army to <hi>Malmuyen,</hi> of which depends all the Country of <hi>Schonen,</hi> in order to beſiege it.<note place="margin">Another memorable Sea fight between the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi>
                  </note> The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army came before that Place on the 19th of <hi>June,</hi> but found there ſo vigorous a Reſiſtance that they were forced to quit it on the 7th of <hi>July</hi> following.

The <hi>Danes,</hi> at their Approach, got into Order of Battle, and ſhewed a great deal of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution.

                  </note> they cut the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet in two. Admiral <hi>Juel</hi> ſignalized himſelf moſt notably, and valiantly bore the Shock of 6 of the Enemies Ships, in which Fray his Ship called <hi>Chriſtian the firſt</hi> was ſo battered and diſabled that he was forced to quit her, and go on Board another, called <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick the third.</hi> In the mean while the main Body of the <hi>Sweediſh</hi> Fleet was put to ſo great a Rout, that they quitted the Fight, and left to the <hi>Danes</hi> a glorious Victory, and a great many of their Ships. For Vice-Admiral <hi>Bielke</hi> took the <hi>Mars,</hi> carrying 72 Guns; Rear-Admiral <hi>Floris Karſtenſz</hi> took the <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> of 60 Guns; Captain <hi>Van Vacht</hi> took the <hi>Flying Wolf</hi> of 56 Guns; Captain <hi>Dreyer</hi> took the <hi>Swediſh Lion</hi> of 52 Guns. The <hi>Dragon,</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 64 Guns, was ſtranded; the <hi>Saturn</hi> was burnt; and the <hi>Jupiter,</hi> carrying 60 Guns, was ſunk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Towards the End of that famous Fight, the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary Squadrons ſent by the States to the Aid of the K. of <hi>Denmark</hi> appeared towards the <hi>Sound,</hi> under the Conduct of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>William Baſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſz;</hi> and came very opportunely to help to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Ruine of the ſhattered Relicks of the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> Fleet, for they cut off the Paſſage of <hi>Gotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> from 3 of their Ships, that were retired near <hi>Malmuyen.</hi> Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> upon his Arrival, went immediately to <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> at whoſe Return a Council of War being held, it was reſolved to ſend a Detachment to attack the ſaid <hi>Swediſh</hi> Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which carried each of them 70 Guns. And that Action was performed in the Sight of the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The Captains <hi>Tyloor</hi> and <hi>de Bois,</hi> that were commanded out upon that Exploit, got a great deal of Honour by it. The firſt of them advanced, and thruſting himſelf between two of thoſe Ships, fired at both of them ſo terribly with his Guns that one of them ſunk, and the other yielded; and the third was burnt by a <hi>Dutch</hi> Fire-ſhip.
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:29562:268"/> In a Word, the whole <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a moſt pitiful Condition, and ſeveral of their General Officers fell into the Hands of the Victors.</p>
               <p>That was the ſecond Victory the <hi>Danes</hi> had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the <hi>Swedes</hi> by Sea that Year. A little while after their two Land-Armies likewiſe engaged again in a cruel Battle, which was fought on the 24th of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> pretty near <hi>Landskroon.</hi> The 2 Kings of the <hi>North</hi> were both there likewiſe in Perſon again, each of them at the Head of his Army, and both Parties being encouraged by their Preſence, fought with ſo much Valour and deſperate Obſtinacy, that it could not well be known to whom the Victory was due. That Battle coſt both Parties the loſs of 5000 Men that were left dead upon the Spot. After the Fight, the <hi>Swedes</hi> again kept the Field of Battle, and the <hi>Danes</hi> retired to <hi>Landskroon,</hi> to repare their Loſſes.</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>de Guldenlieu,</hi> Governour or Vice-Roy of <hi>Norway,</hi> formed an Enterprize upon the important Place of <hi>Marſtrand,</hi> where is a very commodious Port, in which a great Number of Ships may ſafely ride in any Weather.

<pb n="522" facs="tcp:29562:269"/> on the <hi>Danes</hi> ſide were followed by another bloody Battle fought between the two Armies, in which the <hi>Danes</hi> had the better, the <hi>Swedes</hi> leaving behind them about 1400 men Dead on the Spot.</p>
               <p>After the laſt Sea-fight, in which the <hi>Danes</hi> had had the Victory, their Fleet being reinforced with a Squadron of 9 <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War, under the Command of Lieutenant Admiral <hi>William Baſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſz,</hi> put to Sea again. Admiral <hi>Juel,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it in chief, directed his Courſe towards the Country of <hi>Smaland,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Enland,</hi> before which the Fleet anchored on the 11th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi> Where being arrived, 2 Trumpeters were preſently ſent off, one to the Country of <hi>Smaland,</hi> and the other to the Iſle of <hi>Enland,</hi> to ſummon the Inhabitants to come and agree with the <hi>Danes</hi> about Contributions; but they were ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with that Order, that they were ſo inſolent as to abuſe the Trumpeters, and ſent them away very ill ſatisfied. <hi>Tromp</hi> who was on board the Ship called the <hi>Prince George,</hi> came to the fleet accompanied with Vice Admiral <hi>Bielke,</hi> and was ſo ſurpriſed at the ſtrange anſwer and Treatment the Trumpeters met withal, as alſo at the order found on board the <hi>Swedish</hi> Ships there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, importing that if they had had the Victory, they were to deſtroy all the Iſlands belonging to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> with fire and ſword, that he thought fit to ſend the Sieur <hi>Mullet</hi> with a detachment of 200 Soldiers and 100 Seamen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country of <hi>Smaland,</hi> and Vice Admiral <hi>Spaen</hi> with another party of men to the Iſle of <hi>Enland,</hi> with orders to do all the miſchief and ſpoil they poſſibly could there, till they had made the proud hearts of the inhabitants ſtoop to reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thoſe orders were followed with an effectual execution. For the Troops that entred <hi>Smaland</hi> burnt there ſome Lordſhips, ſome Villages, and the ſmall Town of <hi>Munſternaar.</hi> Thoſe ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:29562:269"/> the Iſle of <hi>Enland</hi> put to the Sword 36 Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants they found in arms, burnt ſeveral Villages, and committed a thouſand other ſpoils. Vice-Admiral <hi>Bielke</hi> advancing to the place where the <hi>Swedes</hi> uſed to build their Ships, ſet fire on all the materials ſerviceable either for building or rigging of ſhips; he likewiſe Commanded his men to pillage two Lordſhips and four Villages. In the mean while care was taken, to found the port of <hi>Kalmar,</hi> with a deſign to go in and attack the <hi>Swedish</hi> Ships there; but that was found impracticable becauſe of ſeveral rocks there that lay conceal'd under water, and that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had likewiſe ſunk ſeveral ſhips in the mouth of the Harbour to ſtop up its paſſage againſt any Enemy. All thoſe obſtacles made the <hi>Danes</hi> take a Reſolution to attack the Enemies by Land. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they begun with ſetting fire to a Country houſe about a Cannon ſhot off the Town of <hi>Kal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar.</hi> Thoſe of the Town made what oppoſition they could againſt them by firing their great Guns at them, and ſending ſome Troops againſt them, which the <hi>Danes</hi> beat back to the walls of the Town, and purſued ſo cloſe, that 'tis certain if they had had men enough to have gone through with their attempt they might have entred the Town Pell-Mell with the Enemies, and have made themſelves Maſters of it, ſo great was the conſternation they then were in; and beſides the <hi>Danes</hi> having ſet fire to the Suburbs that conſiſted of 200 Houſes, and 11 Mills, they might well enough have advanced into the Town, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the covert of the thick ſmoak that aroſe from them.</p>
               <p>On the 20th the Admirals <hi>Tromp</hi> and <hi>Juel</hi> took boat with 500 men, and advanced toward the Iſle of <hi>Enland,</hi> with a Reſolution to attack the Fort that ſtands there right againſt <hi>Kalmar,</hi> upon the Sea-ſhore, and which is flankt with 5 Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Baſtions. <hi>Tromp</hi> at his arrival ſent a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:29562:270"/> to the Governour to ſurrender, and upon his refuſal, ordered his men to mount to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault. The Enemies ſeeing themſelves fiercely attacked, made little reſiſtance, but retired into a Wood that is by the ſide of the Fort, and ſo the <hi>Danes</hi> entred and took poſſeſſion of it. That which made the <hi>Swedes</hi> defend themſelves ſo ill, was partly their want of force, and partly their own Cowardice. For they hoped for ſome aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from <hi>Kalmar,</hi> which came not till after the taking of the Fort, and ſo they miſt the benefit of it, becauſe they had not the Courage or Patience to ſtay for it. Thoſe ſuccours being ignorant of the taking of the Fort, <hi>Tromp</hi> haſtily Reimbarkt his Troops in the boats in order to go and meet them; but the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſeeing they were like to be attackt by the <hi>Danes</hi> thought it better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back from whence they came, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to be beaten. However both parties in retiring fired ſeveral vollies of ſmall ſhot one at the other, but without doing much harm excepting only to Vice-Admiral <hi>Spaen</hi> who unfortunately loſt an eye. The Fort of <hi>Borch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm</hi> of which depended the preſervation of the Iſle of <hi>Enland,</hi> had in it a ſtrong Garriſon of 1200 men, and therefore the <hi>Danes</hi> thought not fit to attack it, but contented themſelves with pillaging and ſpoiling the flat Country, from whence they carried off near 2000 head of great and ſmall Cattle, which were ſent to the Fleet.</p>
               <p>And ſince fortune ſmiled ſo upon the <hi>Danes,</hi> and their Arms were every where Triumphant, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> would not be content with the depredations his Troops committed in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Country, but would needs form a further and more important Enterprize upon the Iſle of <hi>Rugen:</hi> For which effect, he ſent for ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of men of his Troops from <hi>Schonen,</hi> and ſent orders to Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> and Lieutenant Admiral <hi>William Baſtiaanſz,</hi> to come to

                  <hi>Copenhagen</hi> with their Squadron; Admiral <hi>Mark Rotſtein</hi> received the ſame order, and to bring with him a detachment of the biggeſt Ships of the <hi>Danish</hi> Fleet. On the 5th of <hi>September</hi> they parted from Admiral <hi>Juel,</hi> who ſeeing there was nothing more to do at <hi>Kalmar,</hi> nor in the Iſle of <hi>Enland,</hi> weighed Anchor the next day, and paſſing by the Country of <hi>Smaland,</hi> he ravaged the Iſles of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>kno,</hi> and <hi>Runo,</hi> where he put ſeveral of the inhabitants to the ſword that attempted to make reſiſtance. After that expedition, he went and attackt 24 of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Magazines near <hi>Weſterwyk.</hi> Captain <hi>Bovenfield</hi> with a party of 150 Seamen, was commanded to go and burn them, who at the ſame time ſet fire to two Lordſhips and three Villages that were higher up the Country, in ſpite of the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Swedes</hi> made with a body of Peaſants that were got together.</p>
               <p>After that, a Reſolution was taken to attack <hi>Weſterwyk,</hi> and burn it, for which execution choice was made of ſome of the lighteſt Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats in the Fleet, with which were ſent a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 500 Soldiers, and as many Seamen under the Command of General <hi>Mullet</hi> and of Rear-Admiral <hi>Floriſz Karſtenſz.</hi> On the 10th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> they preſented themſelves at the mouth of the Haven of <hi>Weſterwyk,</hi> where they lodged two Frigats which fired hotly at the Baſtion of <hi>Sparoſund,</hi> whilſt on the other ſide, the Generals advanced with their Boats into the Port to view in what place they might beſt make a deſcent; and after they had paſt by ſeveral Iſlets, they attackt two Retrenchments, which they took. On the 11th. at break of day, they forced open the Barrier or Boom of the Haven, and ſent in their Fire-Ships and their other ſmall Ships.</p>
               <p>About 7 a Clock the <hi>Danes</hi> preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Town, which appeared to them in the form of a Half-Moon, being adorned with
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:29562:271"/> many fair Houſes and Stately Turrets. From the Sea-ward Captain <hi>Dreyer</hi> fired upon it with his Guns, which the <hi>Swedes</hi> anſwered from a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of 12 pieces of Cannon they had erected on the ſhore. When night came on the <hi>Swedes</hi> threw their Cannon into the water, and Quitted that Poſt, and afterwards the Town; upon which the <hi>Danes</hi> next morning ſeized both the Town and Fort. That place belonged to Count <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſmark.</hi> The <hi>Danes</hi> reduced it all to aſhes, not ſparing ſo much as the ſhips that were in the Harbour. After that great Expedition, the Fleet weigh'd Anchor, and ſailed for <hi>Gothland</hi> after they had put all the Country every where in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, and carried terrour even as far as <hi>Stockholm</hi> the Capital City of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> as we have ſaid, had received order, to go to <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> where he arrived on the 10 of <hi>September,</hi> together with both the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron, and the <hi>Danish</hi> one that was detacht from the main Fleet.</p>
               <p>All things being ready then for a great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had reſolved upon, his Majeſty put himſelf at the head of the Fleet followed by <hi>Tromp,</hi> by the other General Officers of the Fleet, and by 4000 men, being Regular Troops which were embarkt with them. On the 13th. of the month, they weighed Anchor, and on the 16th they came in ſight of the Iſle of <hi>Rugen,</hi> and the next day the great ſhips Anchored at the point of <hi>Wittaw,</hi> whilſt the Galliots and other ſmaller Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were ſent towards the ſhore, between the <hi>Peninſule,</hi> or half Iſland <hi>Wittaw,</hi> and <hi>Jaſmund,</hi> where they Landed their Troops with ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition that about 4 in the afternoon the beſt part of both their Horſe and Foot were already on ſhore. The Commander <hi>Keller</hi> at the head of 30 men, and a Major at the head of 15 <hi>Germans</hi> advanced the foremoſt of all; at their approach a body of the Enemies Cavalry of 100 men fell
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:29562:271"/> upon them and charged them, but after two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges they were fain to flie, not being able a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer to ſtand againſt the fierce firing that was made at them from the ſhips. The <hi>Danes</hi> loſt not one man in that Rencounter and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcharged their Cannon and ſmall Arms for Joy they had had the happineſs to Land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any obſtacle.</p>
               <p>The ſame evening, 50 <hi>Danish</hi> Horſe were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacht away towards <hi>Wittaw</hi> and <hi>Jaſmund;</hi> but they found no body there but ſome Peaſants, and two Horſemen whom they brought Priſoners to the Army. On the 18th the King himſelf and Prince <hi>George</hi> himſelf came likewiſe to Land, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gentlemen of the Country, yielded themſelves and demanded Protections. Four days after his Majeſty departed in order to return to <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen</hi> leaving the Command of his Army in chief to Marſhal <hi>Goltſz.</hi> Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> departed likewiſe with the <hi>Danish</hi> Envoy Mr. <hi>Buckwald,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brand</hi> the Reſident of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> to go to the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who was then em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Siege of <hi>Stetin.</hi> They arrived there on the 22d. Upon whoſe application the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Electour preſently detacht away a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Horſe with orders to go to the Fort <hi>Pennemunder,</hi> to be ready at a Call to back the <hi>Danes</hi> in their enterprize upon the Iſle of <hi>Rugen.</hi> And by that means, the <hi>Danes</hi> were ſo well Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced that Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> that Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Troops in that Iſle, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not in any condition to oppoſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations, and much leſs to give them Battle. However to do what he could, he Commanded the Gentlemen of the Country and all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to come in and joyn him, but Marſhal <hi>Goltz</hi> having publiſht contrary orders, there were very few that ventured to pay obedience to Count <hi>Koningſmark.</hi>

               <p>Neither were the <hi>Danish</hi> Troops Reinforced only by the <hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> but the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> himſelf came and joyned them with a good Body of Horſe, ſo that the Army then was 8000 ſtrong. Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> therefore finding his forces much inferiour to thoſe of the <hi>Danes,</hi> thought it better to Quit the field, than ſtay to be beaten out of it; and therefore retired to <hi>Straelſund,</hi> carrying off with him all he poſſibly could. Thus the <hi>Danes</hi> became Maſters of the whole Iſle, excepting only the Old and New Fort, the firſt of which they took ſoon after, but the latter of them having received a Reinforcement of freſh Troops from <hi>Straelſund,</hi> ſtoutly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all their attacks, and were the cauſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that they were forced to Quit all the Conqueſts they had made there.

That ſignal Victory revived the drooping Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and Re-eſtabliſhed their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs upon ſo good a Foot, that the loſſes and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages either of the Parties had ſuffered by the other that Campaign, were thereby in ſome Fort counterballanced.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſeeing there was no hopes of drawing any ſuccours for that years Campaign from the United Provinces, gave Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to return home, and conferred the chief Command of his Fleet upon Admiral <hi>Niels Juel,</hi> making him Admiral General.

               <p>The Enterprize of Re-entring into the Iſle of <hi>Rugen</hi> being then projected, the <hi>Danish</hi> Fleet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Admiral <hi>Juel,</hi> had order to advance. On the 22d of <hi>September,</hi> Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Lewenhelm,</hi> who Commanded the <hi>Danish</hi> Land-Forces, took poſt at <hi>Wittaw.</hi> The <hi>Swedes,</hi> to the Number of 1000 men, offering to oppoſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, were repulſed with loſs. His Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs having embarkt his Troops at <hi>Pennermund,</hi> came himſelf on board, Commanded to weigh Anchor on the 22d, and made toward the Iſle of <hi>Rugen</hi> with a Fleet of 210 Ships, and 140 Barks, or ſmall Veſſels proper for Landing the Troops in; and thus the Fleet advanced, being ranged in very good order of Battle.</p>
               <p>Marſhal <hi>Dorfling</hi> Commanded the Troops un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Elector; <hi>Tromp,</hi> who engaged in that expedition as a Volunteer, had the Command of the Fleet, and went in the Ship called the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectoral Prince.</hi> In the afternoon a Calm coming on, they were forced to caſt Anchor very near the Iſle. In the mean while the <hi>Swedes</hi> kept fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at the Fleet from a Battery of 10 great Guns and yet in all that time killed but 2 Perſons, which is very remarkable. On the 23d at break of day, Admiral <hi>Juel</hi> having left his own Fleet, came on board the Elector, to inform him, that the <hi>Danes</hi> had taken poſt the day before near <hi>Wittaw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon that advice, the Elector gave order to his people, to weigh Anchor, that he might not give time to Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> to attack the <hi>Danes</hi> before their Junctions, with his Troops. About noon the Calm begun again, ſo that to make the more haſte, they were forced to tow the men of War forward with boats: when they drew near the ſhore, the Troops made uſe of Pikes and Shovels inſtead of Oars, to get to Land with the more haſte; Nay ſome of them jumpt into the Sea, up to the neck in water, and waded to
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:29562:273"/> ſhore, becauſe they would be there the foremoſt and the firſt, to give proofs of their Bravery. At the approach of the <hi>Danes,</hi> the <hi>Swedish</hi> Horſe ſhewed themſelves on the high grounds, and Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> cauſed ſome pieces of Cannon to be advanced, reſolved to fire briskly from them upon the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> before they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the diſorder their Landing would neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put them in: But ſeeing them ſo nimbly get into Battle array, and that they had already got Cannon with them aſhore, he ordered his men to quit the Poſt where they were placed; ſo that the Electors whole Army conſiſting of 4000 men, made a deſcent without any oppoſition from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and without having above two men killed and one wounded.</p>
               <p>Marſhal <hi>Dorfling,</hi> as ſoon as he was Landed, took with him all the Horſe that were yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embarkt, and fell to purſuing the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and 200 Horſe of them having charged 8 Batalions of the Enemies, their conſternation was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, that they turned tail ſoon after. There were taken that day about 200 Priſoners. Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> ſeeing his affairs going down the Wind, was minded to uſe Circumſpection, and thought it high time to rally together the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of his diſperſed and diſpirited Forces, and accordingly he aſſembled them together in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and advanced with them towards the old Fort, with deſign to paſs from thence to <hi>Straelſund,</hi> in caſe of neceſſity. But in the mean while General <hi>Dorfling,</hi> who followed him cloſe at the heels, marcht with that diligence, that the next day he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And whilſt they attackt the <hi>Swedes</hi> on one ſide, a part of their Cavalry lighted from their Horſes, and attackt them on another, ſo that the place was taken by aſſault. A great Number of <hi>Swedes</hi> were put to the Sword in the firſt heat of the attack, and 900 Foot, and 500 Horſe were made Priſoners.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Koningſmark,</hi> after he had ſignalized him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and done as much as man could do, leapt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Boat, and got away from the Victors: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after ſome Regiments were Commanded to go and attack the New Fort; but when the Cannon begun to batter the Ramparts, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon that were <hi>Germans</hi> mutinied, and forced their Officers to ſet open the Gates to the <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgers.</hi> Such was the deſtiny of a Fortreſs which the <hi>Danes</hi> had not been able to take, and which yet ſurrendred at laſt without any reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Arms of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> The Iſle of <hi>Danholm</hi> being afterwards attackt by 2000 men, ſubmitted likewiſe to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Trumphant Arms of the ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector.

This laſt Conqueſt was ſo much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for the Arms of his Electoral Highneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that place was counted one of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ones of all <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <p>The Place enſued ſoon after, and ſome Family conſiderations, beſides ſome particular and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Diſcontents, obliged him at length to quit the Sea and the publick Service till the Year 1691.

               <p>And indeed the preſent King of <hi>England, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> III. had named him to Command the States Fleet as Admiral General for the Year 1691, and the people began already to flatter themſelves with a thouſand happy ſucceſſes from the Joy and Good-Will the Seamen unanimouſly teſtified on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; but the <hi>French,</hi> who are Ingenious in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, thought it was neceſſary to uſe all ſorts of means to prevent ſo great an Evil as ſeemed to threaten them on that ſide: they lookt upon <hi>Tromp</hi> to be the only man that could Traverſe their deſigns, and make head againſt their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power at Sea, the Empire of which they pretend now to diſpute againſt both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland:</hi> ſo that if we may credit what has been reported, the Treacherous Intrigues of that Nation contributed to cure themſelves of the Umbrage and Apprehenſion they had conceived of that Great man, by procuring him an unnatural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper to cut him off on a ſudden. We will enter into no particulars about it; but 'tis too well known, that Court omits nothing to get the ableſt Generals amongſt their Enemies diſpatcht out of the World by one means or other, when they prove deaf to their Charms, and incorruptible, and faithful to their Country.</p>
